1m3mtam,"Fumbled career path, feel like I'm going in circles...","I started as an IB analyst at a BB out of a non targeting school, which was a hot start that I used to feel good amount before Covid. Absolutely grinded for 2 years, got an Associate offer but chose to go into PE. Did that for another couple years, realized I wasn't learning what I thought I would be, and now I'm at a T15 MBA recruiting for...IB associate roles. The same type of roles I could've taken three years ago...without spending $100k+ on tuition.

I'm networking harder than I did as an undergrad. I signed up for WSO courses to refresh some IB technicals, got LinkedIn sales navigator, RecruiterBase and IBContacts subscriptions. I'm literally cold emailing VPs like I'm 20 years old again. My PE experience barely matters because everyone wants to know ""why back to banking?"" and honestly what am I supposed to say... that I thought PE was the promised land but turns out I actually liked the deal flow and variety in IB better? Sometimes I lie in bed calculating where I'd be if I just stayed. VP in 2-3 years probably. No debt. Same exact job I'm recruiting for now except 2 years ahead and without blowing through my savings. Brutal musings....

Has anyone gone from IB analyst to PE then to MBA program only to land back as an Associate? Please DM me if so....",1752897924.0,MBA,Business

1m3cqkd,How to recover from social mistakes during MBA Year 1 at T15?,"A few months ago I finished my first year at a T15 MBA. I grew up with very strict Chinese tiger parents. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to hang out with friends or go to parties and spent all my time on school. All my childhood vacations were visited extended family in China. I studied engineering and became an engineer.

I came to business school to pivot into product management and also to finally learn how to make friends and be more social. My school has a small class size, and at first everyone was very welcoming. I'm skilled at making good first impressions: I'm physically fit and enjoy male fashion.

Over the year I made several mistakes that hurt my reputation. On one overnight trip, people were drinking, doing shrooms, and sharing ""vulnerable"" personal stories. Most shared stories about breakups or family arguments. I got too drunk and high and told a heavy story about my dad beating me, which made people uncomfortable. On another trip, I drank more than I could handle, passed out early, and didn‚Äôt help clean up the Airbnb or wash dishes the next morning. People were upset I didn‚Äôt contribute.

At a crab dinner, I didn‚Äôt know how to eat crab properly and made a big mess, splashing crab water on classmates. At a party someone handed me the Spotify and I played old beyonce and emnem because I don‚Äôt know much current music. People laughed and thought it was strange.

I also misread how close I was with people. After a few trips and late nights I assumed we were good friends, but they didn‚Äôt feel the same way. Someone eventually told me I was coming off as clingy and oversharing. Again, I've been a loner most of my life - those kinds of friendships are new to me.

The classmates who are still friendly are the ones who only see me at happy hours or in class. The ones who spent more time with me on trips seem to avoid me. I feel like I should stick to happy hours, have one drink, and keep conversations light instead of going on trips where people see more of my awkward side.

Career-wise I am doing fine. I have a PM internship and keep things professional at work. But I really wanted to use the MBA to improve socially too, and I feel like I totally messed that up.

For year two, should I just stay low-key, skip overnight trips, and focus on work while keeping it light at happy hours? Or is there a way to repair my reputation and keep trying socially.",1752869695.0,MBA,Business

- policy content intern for an influential figure of the progressive left. 
- data consulting for large natural civic org
- college consulting intern
- digital comms internships w/ U.S. Rep, U.S. Senator

Also: study abroad in Italy, leadership on PA ballot initiative, radio host, etc.

I'm an incoming MBA student (starting this fall) and wanted to get your advice on the best way to organize all the case notes, decks, and readings we‚Äôll be going through.

For context:

* I don‚Äôt use an iPad or take notes by hand anymore. (But would be open to get an iPad if it is trully the best way to take notes)
* I previously did a master‚Äôs in Europe straight out of undergrad, and looking back, I regret not having saved any of my notes, cases, or insights from that program. This time, I want to build a system that I can actually come back to after graduation and find useful.

Right now, I‚Äôm looking advice on two different things:

* **Apps like Notion, OneNote, or Evernote** for digital notes. I‚Äôve tried using Notion in the past as a ‚Äúpersonal brain‚Äù but never fully adopted it, possibly because I didn‚Äôt know how to use it well.
* **Storage System (like OneDrive)** to save cases, PDFs, PowerPoints, etc. I was thinking of creating folders by course, but the challenge is that notes would be separate from the readings unless I manually link them (not a dealbreaker, just a nice-to-have).

Would love to hear:

* What systems or workflows worked for you during your MBA?
* Any tips on how to actually make something like Notion stick?
* If you use a combo of tools (e.g., OneNote + Drive), how do you organize it?

Goal is to not lose track of valuable insights and material like I did in the past. Thanks in advance!",1752882799.0,MBA,Business

1m3646m,Should I go PT (Online) or FT if I currently make 175k and work in Cybersecurity? (Unique Situation),"Hello everyone, I've been lurking here for the past few months but can't nail down an answer for myself as I have a very unique situation (I can pretty much go to any B-School for free). Here's some background:

I am Hispanic, 26, have worked for the last 9 years, 6 of which was in the military. I have tons of leadership experience, Non-Commissioned Officer in Charge of many projects and programs within our Brigade, Was the NCOIC working Clandestine operations living in Eastern Europe and South America for about 5 years (tons of dad lore, beer, and nicotine). Currently working in GRC and Auditing as I have switched to the blue side cyber life.

I used to work in Military Intelligence where I had a strong red team cyber background. I am now 100% Permanently/Totally Disabled and have a ton of benefits that may help my career which I would like to take advantage of. Particularly I have the G.I. Bill **AND** a one time student loan forgiveness (up to 133k or 250k for Ivey I believe). 

I graduated with my B.S. Computer Networks and Cybersecurity with a GPA of 3.67 and will graduate with a M.S. in Cybersecurity Management and Policy this December, both are from a no name school. I have not taken the GRE or GMAT yet as I am planning to apply for schools for next Fall (I'll be 27 by then).

All in all, with my salary, disability pay, and G.I. bill money I am making a little over 175k living in a big city in Texas (cost of living is relatively low).

The question is, do I have the background for a HSW or M7 program and should I shoot for the stars since I pretty much have a full ride anywhere I go, giving up 220k of income for 2 years? Or should I play it safe and complete a part-time online MBA like Kelley while stacking up cash? This is difficult for me since I have never had this much money or have felt this much peace in my life (I am first generation and we didn't have any money growing up). The sweet spot would be marrying my technical background with the MBA in some way but I still need to research what that looks like or if they're are any MBA programs geared that direction.

I also realize that it would be a waste to not take advantage of the opportunity for myself and my future family, I do everything for my kids that don't even exist yet. I feel as if a top school could give me access to a network and opportunities that could set my future kids and their kids up as well.

All perspectives would be appreciated. I ***feel*** its my duty to try to get into a top school, but my ***brain thinks*** the money makes more sense.",1752854234.0,MBA,Business

1m36vwk,How Much Does Your Pre-MBA Job Matter?,"I was laid off two months ago from a research lab job doing something that many would consider highly-specific and niche. It was also quite technical. My undergraduate studies were in business psychology and entrepreneurship. I pivoted to becoming a postbaccalaureate pre-med after I graduated from undergrad due to a push from my loved ones to become a doctor and my strong interest in the sciences. After getting laid off recently, I‚Äôve made the decision to leave the pre-med path as it has been a consistently not-so-great experience for me over the past three years. I will also withdraw from my program. 

I have internships, part-time work, and volunteer work all at startups and medical/clinical/hospital settings. My research job was my first full-time job which I did for nearly three years. I have my story and reasoning laid out for why I want to pursue an MBA (in healthcare/pharmaceuticals), but I haven‚Äôt found a new job yet and I will be applying this cycle. 

I‚Äôve been applying to financial analyst, investment banking analyst and business analyst roles that require 0-1 years of previous experience and I have not heard back. Some have been in healthcare investment banking. I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing wrong but I was hoping to have a more aligned, MBA-specific job during the year before I start a program. It also would have been great to add the role to my resume. I‚Äôm feeling a little lost about this. I‚Äôve called an MBA program to ask admissions and they told me that I should pursue what interests me and that they do not look for specific jobs from applicants (very broad, very vague, which I understand). 

A few questions. Feel free to answer any:

Should I just get an un-aligned job in whatever field that interests me, even if it isn‚Äôt in research?
Or should I keep pushing ahead and applying to analyst roles? 
Does your most immediate role prior to applying to an MBA program matter? 
If you had non-business or finance roles prior to applying, how did you fair?

1m31edg,155 EA ‚Äî Should I apply R1 to Top Schools or Focus on the GRE?,"Hey everyone,

Would love some honest input on my situation. I recently took the EA for the 3rd time and scored a 155 (Q14, V10, IR11). It‚Äôs not a perfect score, but I hit the ‚Äú12+ Quant & 155+‚Äù combo that many consultants and schools say is the general threshold for full-time MBA programs that accept the EA. (Option of retaking the EA is out, I want to leave the 4th attempt for potential EMBA in the future).

I‚Äôm targeting Columbia, NYU, Darden, and Duke if I go the EA route. I received the feedback from some consultants that I should go all in on Round 1 apps with the EA and just focus on executing the rest of my application really well.

That said, I‚Äôve heard (especially about Columbia and NYU) that while 155 is the unofficial minimum, schools may prefer to see something closer to 158+. And I know the EA isn‚Äôt viewed as strongly as the GRE/GMAT at some schools. So I‚Äôm worried that 155 might not be enough at the top programs.

I did take the GRE this year and after a few attempts my highest score is in low teens. I think if I put in focused effort in the next 1-2 months, I could potentially get to the 320‚Äì322 range. But that would probably mean pushing my apps to Round 2, which obviously carries more risk and getting 320+ is not guaranteed either. 

So here‚Äôs my question:
Should I go ahead and apply with 155 EA or postpone the applications to Round 2 and improve the GRE score? 

For context, I‚Äôm an Eastern European applicant with 3.3 GPA from the PAC-12 school and a strong professional background (finance + former pro athlete).

1m2cuae,Still no visa appointment. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.,"I got admit to MBA program in US but still no visa appointment. I check so many times every day, morning, night, again and again. Still nothing. It is already July and I am feeling so much stress now.

I left my job last week, thought I will be leaving soon. Now I am just waiting with nothing. Loan is also stuck because they say visa must be approved first. Tuition is coming but how can I pay if I don‚Äôt even know if I can go? It feels so unfair.

I spent so much money already. GRE, coaching, application fees, SEVIS, visa payment. My family helped me a lot and now I feel guilty and scared. They ask for updates and I have nothing to say.

I don‚Äôt understand why this system is like this. I did everything on time. Why give admission if students cannot even get visa? I worked so hard for this and now maybe I will lose it all for something I cannot control.

Is anyone else still waiting like this? Please tell if you got appointment. I don‚Äôt want to lose this chance. I feel angry and helpless and very tired.

I‚Äôm an incoming MBA2 going through full-time consulting recruiting this fall, and I‚Äôd really appreciate insight from anyone who‚Äôs either recently gone through the process or has friends at MBBs.

I know that full-time is even *more* competitive than summer, and it‚Äôs absolutely critical to be intentional, strategic, and differentiate yourself, especially in this market.

That got me thinking:

**1. Are there certain practice areas at MBBs (especially Bain) that are more open to hiring right now, given market conditions?**

I know interest in tech/digital has cooled a bit, but is there more room in areas like cost transformation, healthcare, ops, sustainability, etc.? I want to focus on what I‚Äôm genuinely excited about, but also stay realistic.

**2. For those who got offers or are plugged into the process ‚Äî what did you do (or see others do) that helped stand out?**

Was it networking early with consultants in a specific practice? Bringing up relevant experience in cover letters/interviews? A specific casing style? 

**3. How do you ""stand out"" but not ""sell yourself""?**

I keep hearing it's key to stand out from others. How do you do that without appearing that you're selling yourself? And if everyone is trying to ""stand out"", then nobody ends up standing out.

Any advice on how to balance passion vs. perceived ‚Äúfit‚Äù or market demand would also be appreciated. Like, what if you‚Äôre passionate about an area that‚Äôs not hiring as much?

1m1jh64,"Complaint: As an international student, IIM doesn't feel like India","Hey all. I'm currently between my 1st and 2nd year at IIM Bangalore as an international student. No major complaints about academics, social life, or recruiting beyond the usual macroeconomic stuff. Nearing the halfway point of my summer internship, still staying in Bangalore.

My biggest complaint though is that IIM doesn‚Äôt feel like India. I wanted to do my MBA in India partly to immigrate here but also to get an ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù experience, and I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm getting that.

By Indian I mean tikka masala, curry, cricket, Diwali celebrations, cricket on every TV, that kind of thing. I‚Äôve always wanted to ride an elephant but they don't allow that because it's ‚Äúoffensive.‚Äù I‚Äôve also always wanted to break into a song and dance routine after seeing RRR or check out a Ralph Lauren textile factory but that‚Äôs not part of IIM culture. We had a thing where we went to Uttar Pradesh and no one even wanted to eat the questionable street food. We don‚Äôt do that in my home country and I've always wanted to try it.

Back in my country when we think of India we think of Bollywood music, tabla drums, snake charmers, sarees and kurtas, paisley prints with little mirrors on them, turbans, cows, henna tattoos, chai stalls, etc. Basically The Jungle Book meets Slumdog Millionaire. I don‚Äôt see that here. There‚Äôs an ‚ÄúIndian cultural‚Äù night at IIM once a year but it‚Äôs mostly pop music and fusion food. Meanwhile people at IIM seem to like EDM or international pop like Dua Lipa or Travis Scott.

I also thought being in India I‚Äôd be in tuk-tuks all the time, but the campus is walkable, and most folks use Ubers or private drivers. I‚Äôve always wanted to grab a chai from a roadside stall poured into a little clay cup by a guy with a thick mustache, but on campus we mostly have vending machines and Nescaf√©.

  
At IIM people drink a lot, way more than I expected. Plenty of people pounding shots and shotgunning beers, playing flip cup, King's cup. After parties you‚Äôll hear Blink-182, Linkin Park, even the occasional Guns N‚Äô Roses or early 2000s hip-hop blasting from someone‚Äôs speaker. No one plays classic Bollywood disco or bhangra remixes or Punjabi rap. The culture feels more American than Indian sometimes, outside of occasionally speaking Hindi.

In my home country we romanticized Indian schools: the pressure, the uniforms, the morning assemblies, the tiffin boxes, the endless after-school tuition. I thought I‚Äôd see call centers everywhere, Bollywood-style dance practice on the lawn, and aunties yelling ‚Äúbeta, come eat!‚Äù from balconies. I grew up watching movies like 3 Idiots and Taare Zameen Par, and thought everyone here lived and breathed exams and engineering prep. For college, I thought people would be into chess, huge Holi color fights, cricket matches, asking people to ‚Äúdo the needful‚Äù, eating spicy street food late at night, that kind of stuff.

Instead Bangalore and IIM feel like a really great international cosmopolitan school with a mix of cultures.¬†People here get more excited about sushi, tacos, Korean BBQ, hummus wraps, poke bowls, and artisanal coffee than about paneer tikka or masala dosa. Lots of people are into clean eating, intermittent fasting, vegan or sattvic diets, when I just want butter chicken, mutton curry, or spicy biryani. I thought that was Indian food. Or roadside vada pav and spicy momos. There's a little dhaba-style spot off campus that's solid, but beyond that, not much.

Before anyone says I should‚Äôve gone to a school in the US, I tried. l was accepted at McCombs, Foster, Carey, and Jones, but thought those schools didn't place enough graduates in India.

Maybe I should just try to get a job in Texas or California if I want that ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù Indian culture.",1752688330.0,MBA,Business

1m2vdvr,Profile Review & Path Advice: 35M Indian Entrepreneur | 680 GMAT | 5-Yr Unemployed | Low GPA | MBA vs. Job?,"Hi¬†r/MBA,

I'm at a major crossroads and would be incredibly grateful for this community's honest feedback. I've spent the last several years on a transformative personal journey and am now deciding between pursuing a top MBA or trying to pivot directly into a corporate marketing role.

PROFILE SNAPSHOT

* Demographics:¬†35-year-old Male, Indian
* Stats:
   * GMAT:¬†680 (Q48, V35)
   * Undergrad:¬†M.Sc.(Tech.) from BITS Pilani (Low GPA -¬†context provided below)
* Work Experience:
   * 9 years total.
   * 2 years as a Manual Test Engineer at an IT firm.
   * \~7 years as a creative entrepreneur (founder of a successful photography/videography business with international clients).
   * Current Status: Unemployed for the past 5 years¬†(context provided below).
* Post-MBA Goals:¬†A leadership role at the intersection of Marketing, Strategy, and Data Analytics, targeting the tech or CPG industries.
* Target Schools:¬†A mix of US (Kellogg, UCLA, Vanderbilt), Canadian (Rotman), and European (ESMT, INSEAD) programs.

BACKGROUND & STORY

* The ""Why"" Behind the Low GPA & Early Career:¬†My low undergrad GPA is a direct result of a significant personal trauma (the loss of my mother) and a difficult family environment that shattered my self-esteem. My early career as a creative entrepreneur was successful, but I knew my foundation was built on intuition and hustle, not on a solid strategic or analytical framework.
* The 5-Year Employment Gap & The ""Comeback"":¬†I recognized I needed to rebuild myself from the ground up. I made a difficult and unconventional decision:¬†I stepped away from my career entirely five years ago to dedicate myself full-time to a complete personal and professional reconstruction.¬†This period culminated in a 3.5-year, all-consuming journey to conquer the GMAT. For me, this wasn't just part-time study; it was my full-time job to rebuild my analytical foundation, overcome my past academic insecurities, and prove my capabilities. The 680 score is the result of that unwavering, single-minded focus.

MY DILEMMA & QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY

My core dilemma is this: Is the massive investment of time and money for a top MBA the right next step, or should I try to re-enter the workforce directly in a marketing role?

I would be grateful for your thoughts on these specific questions:

1. The Employment Gap:¬†How will admissions committees view a 5-year employment gap, even when it is explained by this full-time, transformative GMAT journey? Is this seen as a major red flag, or as a compelling sign of commitment and resilience?
2. Profile Perception:¬†With the added complexity of the employment gap, how will T15-T25 US or top European schools likely view my profile? Is the story strong enough to overcome the combined hurdles of a low GPA and a long period of unemployment?
3. Path Viability (MBA vs. Job):¬†Is the MBA now the¬†only¬†realistic path for me to successfully re-enter the workforce at a high level? How difficult would it be to get a good marketing job directly after a 5-year break?

1m2i6tc,MBA Straight After Undergrad?,"Hi all,

I currently attend a non target school in the US and want to break into high finance post grad (IB, PE, HF, VC, etc.).  I was thinking that due to my low tier school status and having missed recruiting cycles for internships due to originally being a computer science major, that I probably need an MBA to do what I want to do. I was hoping to get some feedback from others on whether it would be worth it to go straight from undergrad to MBA if I know what I want to do will likely require it.

I would be open to doing full time mba in the US or the EU (English speaking courses). 

My stats are: 3.4 GPA, 3.7 in major GPA, 1 IT internship (when CS major), 1 business development internship. Even though I‚Äôm at a very much non target, I am on a prestigious academic scholarship. I am joining the student asset management club next semester and am involved in financial planning club. Also have many volunteer hours and extra curricular‚Äôs (like soccer, basketball, etc). 

Also, if anyone could maybe chance me for some of the popular mba programs that‚Äôd be great. I‚Äôm obviously not expecting to get into an ivy or anything, but some of the top EU schools and upper middle tier schools in the US (Darden, Fuqua, Keenan-Flagler, Goizueta) sound appealing.

I‚Äôm a 26-year-old based in the UAE, currently earning 20,000 AED/month in a senior tech role. I‚Äôm aiming to transition into a product manager or strategy role earning 40‚Äì45k AED/month in the next few years. Eventually, I want to build my own startup, not chase MBB or VC jobs.

üìà Career Path I‚Äôm Considering:
	‚Ä¢	At 27: Do Warwick‚Äôs Online MBA (while continuing to work in UAE)
	‚Ä¢	At 28: Apply for Cambridge MBA (full-time) ‚Äî if I get a scholarship, it‚Äôs within my budget. Oxford is out of reach financially.

The total cost difference between Warwick Online MBA and Cambridge MBA is about 1 crore INR (~$120,000 USD) when you include opportunity cost.

By the time I‚Äôm done with either MBA, I aim to be earning 40-45k AED/month, or building my own company.

‚∏ª

üí≠ My Key Questions:
	1.	Will a Warwick Online MBA at 27 be enough to make the transition to product/strategy or support a future startup?
	2.	Is the 1 crore INR cost difference worth it for a Cambridge MBA at 28, even if I‚Äôm not aiming for MBB or VC?
	3.	If I self-learn PM, AI, BlockChain and startup skills and reach 30k/month by 27, do I even need an MBA?
	4.	For someone already in UAE, does network and prestige of Cambridge significantly open doors compared to Warwick Online?

‚∏ª

Any honest input, especially from those in UAE or who‚Äôve taken either path, would be amazing.

3. Which banks tend to re-recruit more heavily? Know this is completely situation dependent, but I know some banks give out an excess of summer offers with attrition built into FT staffing projections.

I‚Äôm currently working in human capital and people analytics at a regional bank, and I‚Äôm applying to T15 and above MBA programs this fall. Post-MBA, I‚Äôm looking to pivot into investment banking, and to this point I‚Äôve  assumed that Debt Capital Markets (DCM) or Leveraged Finance (LevFin) align with my long-term goals and especially my story.

Here‚Äôs the core of my story: I eventually want to work at a fund that manages capital for nonprofits‚Äîsomething like an OCIO‚Äîwhere I can help mission-driven organizations grow and preserve their capital. Since nonprofit portfolios often rely heavily on stable, income-generating debt instruments, I thought building expertise in DCM or LevFin would be a great foundation.

But in a recent chat with someone in IB, I was told that DCM and LevFin aren‚Äôt typical post-MBA landing spots‚Äîespecially not for pivoters without prior finance experience. Now I‚Äôm wondering if adcoms and recruiters will view this angle as too niche or disconnected from more common post-MBA IB paths.

So I‚Äôm stuck. Do I:
	‚Ä¢	Stick with the DCM/LevFin story because it‚Äôs authentic and connects well with my long-term goal?
	‚Ä¢	Or pivot the short-term story to something more standard (like M&A or ECM), and tie it back to nonprofit investing later?

1m0nrs5,"At my T15, I've gotten along fine with every other ethnicity, except for white people. Any tips?","So I go to a T15, full-time. Our class size isn't that big. We are relatively racially diverse, and I've generally had a blast during my first year. The birthday parties, themed house parties, overnight domestic trips, international treks, clubbing, school functions, on top of the academic stuff like group projects etc. Same with professional groups like mock casing for consulting or PM.

People think I'm fairly social and while I wouldn't call myself the most ""popular,"" I'm definitely not unpopular and get along wit most everyone. I'm Asian American (East Asian), and have been integrated into multiple friend groups including LatAm folks (the most social and open), other Asian-Americans, Indian-Americans, international South Asians, international East Asians, international Europeans, black students, hispanic students, etc.

However the one group I've not been able to crack is the white people. They have their own friend group (not hating, the cliques are kind of racially and socioeconomically segregated). The white people have their own parties, ski trips, international trips, etc., and don't really invite others in the class except a few people of color who have become friends with them.

I'm not hating on friend groups or cliques, but throughout my life, I have never been able to connect with white people. The white people are ""polite"" to me at happy hours, but they very quickly lose interest in continuing the conversation and go away. It's apparent from their facial expressions and body language. I feel way more ignored and invisible around them than actively bullied - I did want to make that point clear.

It's not just an MBA thing though, this has happened all throughout my life. However, it is a problem I want to fix because a lot of white people do hold power in the business world, and getting them to like you can be very important for career advancement. This happened at my old workplace where I didn't see advancement under a white boss, but when I switched teams to a latino boss, we got along way more and he promoted me.

So I want to learn tips on how I can be more likable to white people for practical career reasons. The soft skills stuff, not just be seen as a hard worker but someone they can have beers with.

For reference, I'm a typical Asian-American guy who grew up playing tennis, drinking boba, watching anime and k-pop etc. Got an econ degree and worked in corporate finance. I learned to be into more normal things during work to fit in like pick up basketball and follow sports. Now am doing a Product Marketing internship in tech, but a lot of the team here is still white.

I feel it harder to relate to white women especially just because of vast differences, but white men aren't easy either.

I've noticed the white people at my program tend to have a bit more of a reserved demeanor as opposed to super gregarious or open (unlike the LatAm people). They tend to be a little more quiet, except for when they're drinking, and are extremely fashionable, and into things like skiing, playing sports, traveling, wineries etc. (not saying other ethnicities aren't). I have found I can't be too lackadaisical or eager or energetic around them, turning my energy level down helps a little bit.

And to be clear, not every white person is in the ""white people clique"" at my MBA, some are actually friends with the Asians, a few with the black folks, but there is a white people clique and I've had 0 success at getting them to even just not ignore me. I don't care about being ""in"" with them as much. Personally I've found Jewish people the easiest white people to befriend. The few white people I befriended growing up were also nerdy, but there are only a few of those at my MBA.

So I wouldn't say the white people are being racist to me, but they are uninterested and indifferent to me, and ignore me. It's not just me, many other people of color on campus (except a few) similarly feel it's difficult to break into ""white circles."" Any tips to change this would be great.",1752599938.0,MBA,Business

1m18gsu,Should I accept the Columbia J-Term offer or wait for a HSW R1 attempt ?,"Hi everyone,  
I just got admitted to the Columbia J-Term ‚Äî which, to be honest, I originally saw as more of a ""dry run"" to prepare for R1 apps to HBS/Stanford/Wharton. But now that I'm in‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm seriously questioning whether it‚Äôs worth taking the risk of reapplying elsewhere.

A bit about me:

* Sponsored by MBB (I'll return post-MBA)
* GMAT: 680 (a legacy score, didn't retake yet)
* International profile
* Costs aren‚Äôt a major concern thanks to the sponsorship, though NYC rent & living costs are a factor to consider
* J-Term's accelerated timeline is appealing, but I have some FOMO around the broader campus experience at H/W

I‚Äôm mainly wondering:

* Would turning down CBS J-Term for a shot at H/W really be worth it ‚Äî in terms of prestige, network, and long-term positioning?
* Is a 680 even competitive for H/W, especially given I'm not from a particularly underrepresented background?
* Also, minor logistical question: if I go with CBS, how feasible is it to host friends/family in Columbia housing?

Would love your thoughts ‚Äî especially from those who‚Äôve made similar decisions or know folks who did.

I was fortunate to receive deferred admits from both Kellogg and Columbia, and I‚Äôd love to get some perspectives on which might be the better fit for me.

At this stage, I‚Äôm still exploring my interests and keeping my options open across consulting, operations, marketing, and general management. I might choose to pursue these functions in a non-traditional industry such as media, sports, or entertainment.

Kellogg really stands out to me for its collaborative culture, strong leadership development, and exit opportunities in more traditional post-MBA roles.

Columbia has a better non-traditional route with the added advantage of NYC.  That said, I do have some concerns about the larger class size and the possibility of the student community feeling a lot more dispersed.

1m1bhiz,FT MBA or pass?,"I‚Äôm a long-time browser in this subreddit, first-time poster, and wanted to get some feedback on my situation. I currently work for a fund admin shop where my work involves investor reporting and financial operations/fund accounting (pretty mind-numbing stuff). I have 5 YOE since undergrad (currently 27 YO) and have worked for a couple of the bigger names in the space. I was recently promoted to a manager position and fortunate enough to make around 130-140K TC in a relatively LCOL area. That being said, I definitely feel a bit pigeonholed in this industry and don‚Äôt really enjoy the work itself, as very few do. I‚Äôm interested in pivoting to a product management or client management role, just not sure if I‚Äôd be able to do so within my current company any time soon given that transfers out of ops/reporting roles are pretty rare. The corp structure is also fairly rigid/siloed, which makes pivots challenging. Leadership is pretty content with keeping people in accounting/ops/reporting roles as long as possible. I can‚Äôt really see myself doing this for another 5-10+ years if I‚Äôm being honest, unless I move to a director level role where I‚Äôm more removed from the day-to-day. 

With this in mind, I‚Äôve been considering the possibility of applying to FT MBA programs for Fall 2027. Consulting, product management, and corporate strategy roles are certainly of interest to me. I‚Äôm just not sure if my relatively niche/non-traditional experience in fund admin would hurt my chances for recruitment, even if I were to get accepted to a T15 school. I haven‚Äôt taken the GMAT/GRE yet but typically do well on standardized testing. I also had a 3.9 GPA in undergrad from a reputable state school in the South and earned a business management degree. I think I could get into a solid school if I play my cards right. However, I‚Äôm aware that even graduates from top schools have been struggling to find work, including those with more traditional pre-MBA backgrounds. I could attend without taking on considerable debt fortunately, but the prospect of graduating to make the same comp or less in a higher cost of living area is a nerve wracking outcome. I think it would really only make sense for me financially if I came out with TC of 175-200k+, which is certainly not the case for everyone in this market. It‚Äôs hard to say what the landscape will look like when I‚Äôd hypothetically matriculate in 2029. 

I should note that my company also has tuition reimbursement, which I could use to go to a PT/online MBA program. That being said, I‚Äôm doubtful that a PT/online MBA would assist me greatly in pivoting out of ops and would probably just assist in positioning myself for more senior ops/middle office roles externally. I‚Äôm always open to feedback, new ideas, and constructive criticism. Thank you for reading my post and any insights you can offer, Reddit! ",1752669489.0,MBA,Business

I was talking to a friend of mine to invite her to a party and I told her she can bring her new boyfriend along. Then she told me he wasn't her boyfriend and just a guy she was casually hooking up with.

She ended up admitting that most of her girl friends are the same where they have fun with the really attractive guys when they are young in uni and then later on settle down with the 'nice stable guy' who has a good career and makes decent money.

She told me many of the really attractive guys don't have much else going for them career wise and obviously her parents would want her to be with a guy who has good future prospects.

1m0sad3,Does an MBA make sense for me?,"Hi all,

Feeling very lost right now. I‚Äôm 3 years out of undergrad. Worked for a year and a half at a very well known nationwide nonprofit as an admin assistant in development. Hated it and wanted to do more policy and government work so I moved to a different nonprofit. Currently in my role for about a year and 10 months now, I was promoted once and am due to be promoted again in a few weeks. In my current role, I am mostly doing admin work, some policy work and community engagement.

I am very burnt out in my work, feeling stuck with very little change happening and it‚Äôs been very disheartening. I was very naive and jaded coming out of undergrad and wanted to work in a nonprofit doing meaningful work but seeing such poverty takes a toll on you and working with community has a lot of emotional toll.

I want to pivot to corporate and but unsure what I want to do. It‚Äôs such a different world from what I know and I was never really a business person or think of things from a business perspective. I am tired of making very little pay doing thankless work and I want to use my brain. I don‚Äôt feel very intellectually stimulated doing administrative work and I genuinely hate it with such a passion.

Would pivoting to corporate be the next move with an MBA or should I just continue this route and do a masters in public policy? I think I want to pivot into consulting next with the MBA or into tech policy instead of the social Justice policy space I‚Äôm in which will be difficult w no tech background. I don‚Äôt feel very confident with my chances of getting in. Graduated from Berkeley with a 3.5 GPA in sociology but I did get a C+ in stats and not very good in math overall which can always be improved if I study up for the GRE.

I‚Äôve been lurking on this page and it seems like a lot of folks come from very finance/tech/consulting backgrounds and haven‚Äôt really seen nonprofit folks make a career switch. I am grateful for any advice. Thanks. ",1752610041.0,MBA,Business

Guard your brand and reputation.","I'm 10 years out of the MBA, at an M7 mind you, and I can confidently say people still judge former classmates based on negative things they did during the program. If someone built a reputation for slacking on group assignments, getting consistently overly drunk at social functions, acted weird/creepy toward the other gender, said racist/homophobic stuff, openly did too many hard drugs, cheated on their spouse, people STILL bring up those incidents.

People will use incidents from 10 years ago to justify refusing to give a job referral to someone who acted indecently during the program. It doesn't matter if you've changed and grown, and become a family man or woman, it doesn't matter if you've matured.

People will remember you by how they remember you. You can change and grow all you want, but there's no recognition of redemption. People stop paying attention to social media updates from classmates a few years out, so no one will keep ""tabs"" on your growth.

Almost nothing you can do can salvage your reputation post-MBA. The only exception is if you somehow magically become a celebrity or an indisputable business leader. Which is unlikely for most of the MBA weirdos.

The weirdos who got ostracized during the program had to rely on referrals from classes from other years, not their immediate class, or the part time/exec program.

So be very careful how you show up during the MBA program. People may seem nice and chill but people ARE judging others and making value assessments. Guard your reputation and personal brand at all costs. Have fun, yes, but never be ""that guy."" ",1752516277.0,MBA,Business

1lyxmam,"I make $75k a year as a public school teacher in Queens, NYC and live just fine. People on this MBA sub are delusional to think $200k is ""bare minimum.""","Often times on this sub, you'll see people saying they'll not accept anything below $200k total comp in MBB, investment banking, or tech. My own older brother went to an M7 MBA (UChicago Booth) and works in finance, and to him, $200k coming out of grad school is ""low income.""

However, I'd like to offer a counterpoint. I'm in my mid 30s, and I only make $75k as a public school teacher. I live in Queens, NYC. I don't live in a bad area. And my quality of life is just fine.

First, I'm totally okay still living with roommates. If you find the right roommates, this can actually be fun. If you make low enough income like me, you can also quality for affordable housing or housing subsidies through NYC. This cuts down my housing costs quite a bit. But even before I got the affordable housing lottery, splitting costs with roommates in the outer boroughs made things affordable. 

Keep in mind roommates in your 30s are normal, even for higher income folks ($200k) in NYC and other VCHOL places like San Francisco. My own brother got into investment banking after his UChicago Booth MBA and lived with 2 other guys in Manhattan for a while. He did it because he found roommates to be fun and he could throw parties at his apartment. 

Second, I'm OK with not eating out a ton, maybe once or twice a month, and cooking at home the overwhelming amount of time. NYC has a lot of ""dollar pizza"" and inexpensive eateries too that make food work. I can also go out to bars once a week, I'll just have one beer or two. I'm past the age of wanting to drink a lot or do shots or get cocktails, the hangovers hurt. Or I'll just get a six pack from a liquor store and we'll pregame at home for cheap. 

I use public transit 100% of the time, so no need to own a car, pay for gas, maintenance, insurance etc. That cuts down on costs as well.

Third, plenty of social activities in NYC are free or low cost, or outdoors so you absolutely don't have to spend a ton to enjoy music, comedy, working out etc. I just take the subway to prospect or central park and job around over the gym and do weights at home. I'm also more of a home body and play video games in my apartment which takes up some social time. 

Having said this, I still have enough money saved up to go on trips, I can do one international trip for about 1.5 weeks a year. One year I went to Coachella with friends. Another year I did Disneyland. And I have my entire summer off where I can just chill, or do tutoring for supplemental income. Having summers off is such a godsend. 

I've been thinking of getting a Master's to increase my pay by $30k+, but even then I'd make max $100-125k living in NYC which is still low income to many of you guys. 

I also have no interest in having kids although I'd like to eventually get a husband one day. I feel comfortable with retirement by being on the pension system + Social Security. Tenure gives me good job security, it becomes difficult for me to arbitrarily lose my job. And the teachers union has my back. 

I'm single right now, but don't need an expensive or fancy wedding, a courthouse wedding is just fine. Don't feel a huge need to save up to buy a house either, I like living in NYC. 

Lots of higher income folks are opting to not have kids as well.

1lzqtte,NYU PT MBA worth it?,"Hey everyone, curious on whether people think a PT MBA makes sense in my situation. I have 3 YOE in corporate finance and make roughly $130k in NYC.

NYU PT would be $170k with my employer covering $20k. I‚Äôm confident I could cover the $150k from current and future savings and not have to go into debt or pull from my 401k early. 

To me the ROI doesn‚Äôt seem to be there if I did a FT MBA as I‚Äôd exit into a FLDP role making $140k or so. The opportunity cost would be around $400k, which would only have an ROI if got an exec role (at that point just do an exec MBA if you‚Äôre at dir/vp level).

* also - not looking to change the industry; want to continue being a PM in the same industry. Ideally at SF

Given this, I'm thinking that summer-internship is prob not necessary for me and I can save money / time doing a shorter MBA, giving my age and that I'm married, a 1 year program is really appealing to me.   
  
Have been going through the programs and find NYU Tech MBA and Kellog's 1 year (Kellogg confirmed that I am eligible) are suitable with good chance to find a job as a PM.

I'm thinking that if I do a 2-year MBA (given the cost of an extra year of university and not earning a salary), I need to get into the best university that will help me find the job I want, and I'm considering:

Berkeley Haas  
MIT Sloan

Would love guidance on 2 questions:

1. Am I in a good place to find a job without the internship?
2. Any other programs you would suggest? Specially 2Y programs? Haas and Sloan are extremely difficult to get in. (I have a GRE of: 167Q - 155V and GPA: 3.3)",1752514896.0,MBA,Business
1lzr5ow,HBS 2 + 2 Advice + Profile Review,"Hello there, I am new to this subreddit so please take it easy if I don't know some common knowledge. I'm looking for a review and some advice on the deferred admissions MBA programs at top schools. 



Academics: I am studying International Business Analytics at a mid tier university in the UK and have pretty good grades 2 years through (equivalent of a 4.0 and top 3 in my class).  I'm doing an exchange program at Columbia for my 3rd year (would appreciate some advice on opportunities to look out for or general things to do and not do). It would be safe to assume my GPA will dip slightly at Columbia. 

  
Test scores: Will take GRE soon (assume I got the the median or higher than the median for these schools)



Other stuff: I have founded and am vice-chairman of 4 colleges in rural India, have led them to become the best for specific courses in 3-4 districts. Have been awarded 1 scholarship and 2 research assistantships in the Economics department so far (hoping for more in the next 2 years). Vice-president of the Cinema Society, could become president in my final year. Honestly managing the colleges along with the RA jobs really take up all my time I can't seem to accomplish more. I've seen some posts here with people having such extensive CVs being really high level at everything and I don't know how people do it. 

  
Why MBA: I really want to grow the colleges into a university. Once a university is created I can set the standard I see fit to award degrees and truly lift the level of education there. However, as everyone could guess, it would take an incredible amount of skill and effort to do that which I hope an MBA would prepare me to do. My story for the application would be centred around this, with my research supporting this (the research is about how income doesn't have the best predictive capabilities when looking at happiness/fulfilment; rather a combination with education and healthcare). 

  
Along with a profile review it would be great if you guys suggested some specific things I could do in the 1.5-2 years I have to strengthen this application. Thanks!",1752510738.0,MBA,Business

1lzof9s,Current comp $96k. Is MBA right for me?,"Hello

24M based in Texas at large Oil & Gas company. I work in the digital space (Data analyst) ($96k total comp) focusing on big data, business process improvement, and workflow automation, as well as some app building for stakeholders. I'm in the final year of a rotational grad program, and expect a $10-$15k promotion following completion of the program. Also, I have a 324 gre score and 3.8 undergrad GPA from UIUC.

I'm thinking of applying to a T25 MBA program in 1-2 years but don't know if it makes sense for me. I've heard some programs really like taking more technically inclined candidates, and I'd be targeting tech consulting, product management, or management consulting in order of preference post MBA.

a. If going for an MBA makes sense for me given my background and desired outcome? 

b. What schools should I be targeting?

c. Is it worth the opportunity cost?

1lz5gxd,Laid Off from International Development ‚Äî Is Pursuing an MBA at GW the Right Move?,"Hi all,

I‚Äôm hoping to get some outside perspective as I try to make a big decision about pursuing an MBA.

I‚Äôve spent the last 10 years working in international development, primarily implementing USAID-funded programs both in the U.S. and abroad. I‚Äôve served as a Program Manager, leading civic engagement, education, and gender equality initiatives in fragile and conflict-affected countries. My background is in foreign affairs and public health, and I‚Äôve always been passionate about work that supports marginalized communities.

But‚Ä¶ things have changed.

Due to the recent federal cuts to foreign assistance, I was laid off‚Äîand so were many of my peers. The job market (especially in the DMV area) is extremely saturated, and the entire sector feels uncertain. I‚Äôm now in a period of transition and seriously considering a career pivot into the private sector‚Äîspecifically roles in CSR (corporate social responsibility), impact investing, ESG consulting, or social entrepreneurship.

I was recently accepted to the Accelerated MBA program at George Washington University, and I‚Äôve always envisioned pursuing an MBA at some point, and it seems like the logical next step. But I‚Äôm hesitant because:

- The cost is still high (over $100K even with aid + loans)
- I‚Äôm unsure if GW‚Äôs brand and career services are strong enough for my pivot
- I fear graduating with debt and not finding the right job post-MBA, especially in such a volatile job market.  

Has anyone here pivoted out of international development into private-sector impact roles with an MBA?

Would you recommend attending a mid-tier program like GW now, or waiting to apply to other MBA programs with stronger career pipelines and scholarship support?

Open to any advice, especially from folks who‚Äôve faced an industry collapse, pivoted from mission-driven work, or attended GW.

1lzsvb8,Okay honestly‚Ä¶ what are the real benefits of taking the GMAT over the GRE? There has to be some.,"So I‚Äôve been researching both tests, and yeah I keep hearing the same thing:
‚ÄúTake the one you‚Äôll score higher on.‚Äù
But let‚Äôs be real ‚Äî if both are accepted, why do so many serious MBA applicants still default to the GMAT? There has to be some actual advantage to taking the GMAT‚Ä¶ right?

Honestly, it just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me because the GRE is obviously easier ‚Äî like the quant is way more straightforward, you can use a calculator, and the verbal is just vocab-heavy but manageable if you study. So if schools really treat them the same, why wouldn‚Äôt everyone just take the GRE and make their life easier? That‚Äôs why I feel like there has to be some unspoken bias or behind-the-scenes preference for the GMAT.

Like:
	‚Ä¢	Perception by adcoms: I‚Äôve read that admissions committees say they treat both equally, but then some consultants and former adcoms hint that the GMAT is still the ‚Äúgold standard.‚Äù Supposedly it shows you‚Äôre more ‚Äúserious‚Äù about business school. Is this actually true? Or just internet gossip?
	‚Ä¢	Placement and recruiting: I heard some firms (especially in consulting and IB) ask for your GMAT score during recruiting. I know many companies have done this by talking to MBA students who received FT roles by now. Does that mean having a GRE puts you at a disadvantage if you‚Äôre targeting MBB or bulge bracket IB? Anyone experience this firsthand?
	‚Ä¢	Scholarships: I‚Äôve also seen that GMAT scores tend to correlate more directly with MBA merit aid ‚Äî like some schools have scholarship tiers where GMAT scores unlock bigger money. Not always the case with GRE.
	‚Ä¢	Quant section: The GMAT quant is harder than the GRE quant. So if you score well on GMAT quant, maybe that helps offset a lower undergrad GPA in math or a non-quant background?

For example:
I saw someone on GMAT Club say they got into Kellogg with a GRE, but the adcom specifically asked about their quant ability and work experience to compensate. Meanwhile, someone else with a similar profile and a strong GMAT score got in with money.

On the flip side:
I also know people who crushed the GRE (330+), got into top 10 MBA programs, and never had an issue. Some even say GRE verbal is tougher, so it helped them stand out. So clearly it can work ‚Äî but it seems like you need to ‚Äúprove‚Äù yourself a little more?

So yeah‚Ä¶ curious if anyone here:
	‚Ä¢	Chose GMAT over GRE and felt it paid off
	‚Ä¢	Took the GRE and never looked back
	‚Ä¢	Regretted doing GRE instead of GMAT for MBA or recruiting

1ly16sg,ROI on an MBA,"DISCLAIMER: My comments are geared towards domestic students however international students may find value in what i say below.


I've been on other people's post commenting on the value of an MBA. Its astounding how people are so uninformed that it push me to make this point. 

Let's start with age.

Age in the MBA process is not as important as your goals and fit with the program. The older you are, the more your goals have to be rock solid! The sweet spot for MBAs are 27-33. Anybody younger or older than this range will have to have an even more compelling reason why they want a MBA. My advice is an MBA is generally more valuable with experience than with very little. I would never advise anyone to go and get an MBA straight out of undergrad or someone with very little work experience. 

As far as ROI, let me say this. I believe the ROI is heavily a start from what you are making or was making from your job before the MBA. In my humble opinion,

If you are making $100K or below prior to the start of your MBA, you will see a lot of value in it if you go to a T-30 school especially if you have a partial scholarship. If you go to a T-15 school,  this can be a game changer (even more valuable) even if you are going at sticker price.

If you are making between $100K - $200K, the ROI can be borderline but depends on your goals.  What do you hope to achieve out? Keep in mind that this is solely based on your research and what the school offers. It doesn't make sense to apply to most programs due to your goals and may only target certain specific schools.

If you are making $200K or more, I don't think a full-time MBA is worth it unless you plan to pivot into finance. When you are making this amount before your MBA,  it may make a ton of sense to just apply to an Executive or Part-time MBA program.

I work with a ton of MBAs from the T-30 schools. People who have gone to schools like Stanford, Wharton, Chicago Booth, Yale SOM, UW Foster, UCLA Anderson, WashUOlin and Emory Goizueta.  The students who sees the most immediate ROI are people who was making less than $100K before starting the MBA. But keep in mind that an MBA is supposed to be a lifelong return on investment. It supposed to pay dividends over the horizon of your career, so please keep that in mind. ",1752328902.0,MBA,Business
1lxin3x,Private equity people are filth and their entire industry is human waste,"People who work in private equity are human feces. They crawl into companies, shove their snouts in, rip out everything of value, and leave behind a rotting carcass for everyone else to clean up.

Their business model is simple. Load companies with debt, fire workers, sell anything that can be sold, and walk away richer while employees, customers, and entire towns get crushed. They call it value creation because calling it looting would be too honest.

They buy nursing homes and cut staff so severely that elderly people die in their beds. They buy retail chains, strip them for parts, bankrupt them, and wipe out thousands of jobs. They destroy pensions and gut communities while pretending they‚Äôre optimizing capital as if that excuses anything.

These people are not investors or builders or even real capitalists. They are parasites. Even parasites have a role in nature. Private equity is sewage, nothing but toxic runoff poisoning everything around it.

1lygkrv,"Looking for advice: 11 yrs experience, Sr. Director, seeking hybrid/online","I've started to seriously consider an MBA this year and I've done a bit of research, and feeling a bit stuck in my decision making.

Here's my basic profile:

- **Undergrad:** 2.8 GPA from Isenberg (UMass)
- **GMAT/GRE**: haven't taken yet but historically test well, if this means anything conversationally
- **Work experience**: 10 years in project management, business development, strategy
- **Current Role**: Project Mgr -> Dir -> Sr. Dir in last 3.5 years. Employer is a $150M service provider
- **Program Needs**: I need to do a hybrid or online MBA
- **Goal**: growth with existing company // industry

**Bit of backstory**  
First 7 years of career with one employer were good but became stagnant. Changed employers in a parallel industry, it's been a very productive 3 years. Two promotions in 3 years, I have my CEO's ear and the company is willing to sponsor 50-100% of my MBA.

Current company is $150M revenue, ultimate goal is SVP/COO type role with current firm ++ similar opportunities elsewhere.

**What am I looking for**
After a bunch of research...is an online from Isenberg/Tepper/Ilinois/BU good enough? Do I have the credentials to get into a T20 school? For my goals, is there much difference in the value of credentials between an online, hybrid, or full time on site? I truly believe maximizing experience in person makes a big difference, but a full time program is not an option for me.

**Hybrid:** I live 2 hours from Boston and I'm also trying to figure out if there are any hybrid programs in the Boston area that both I am qualified for, and would be worth the effort to commute to periodically, instead of a full online. Even UMass Isenberg hybrid, valuable?

**Online:** What's worth the money in the $30-60k range? Should I pursue Isenberg / Illinois / BU? Or are there better options towards the top of this range I should pursue?

At the end of the day I don't want to sell myself short, and I want to know what's best given my experience/undergrad and relative budget.",1752369948.0,MBA,Business
1lyfkdu,B-School: Reset or Rationalized Detour?,"I‚Äôm heading to a T15 MBA this fall, and I keep asking myself: Is this truly the best next step, or am I just rationalizing a detour that feels safe?

Here‚Äôs the situation. I used to be at McKinsey. I‚Äôve built a few things, and right now I‚Äôm working on a startup I really believe in. It‚Äôs too early to support me full time right now, but in two years, I‚Äôm confident it will be. And if it‚Äôs not? I‚Äôll be able to land a solid job after business school. I‚Äôm not worried about employability.

I recently came out of a long depressive stretch, and part of what draws me to b-school is the chance to reset: to rebuild structure, energy, and clarity. Honestly, if the degree helps me get back to myself and launch the next chapter, I‚Äôm willing to take on the debt. If that means $2K/month payments for 20 years, I can live with that.

What I am struggling with is all the b-school skepticism I keep hearing, especially from the startup world. That it‚Äôs a waste of time. That it kills momentum. That if you were serious about building, you‚Äôd just build.

So here I am, stuck between two narratives:
	
‚Ä¢	One says this is a smart long-term investment in myself and my vision.
	
‚Ä¢	The other says I‚Äôm taking a detour because I‚Äôm scared to go all in.

1ly0ko8,Life After MBA for non-Tech/Data/AI roles,"Some truths for a life post MBA

Once you are done with MBA, unless you move into a role that's pertaining to Data or AI (Tech), basically an introvertish lifestyle, most of your job will revolve around:

1. Alignment - Freaking glorified word for diplomatically sucking up. Took me some time to realize the importance of this word. 

2. Read between the lines - Be it sales or consulting or networking or fund raising. You have to develop human reading skills. Very few handful of companies in the world have open communication thought process. Otherwise, most of the world relies on you having the skill to listen very well and also listen to what's not being said. 

3. Be ready to have a flamboyant lifestyle - this is about having those yearly vacations, those fancy dinners, etc. Or pretend you do, especially if you can't afford to, for as long as possible. This is not because you have to show-off the money you don't have, but because as you move into organizations that value MBA immediately, you will notice this is what people talk about every other non-work meeting. And you gotta keep up. 

4. Alliances - be very ready to change your alliances in official life very often. This includes the skill to make up and talk when to your adversaries to get them to your side. And to lose some friends as you are forced to back stab them. 

I couldn't take all this, especially after a daughter. Had done consulting across the world, sales and marketing for top names, tech for number of F500 only to realize how everything is fucked when you reach 40. Messed up my family and everything after running behind the growth and flamboyance and realised the important things in life are not those LinkedIn posts or those fancy holidays, but that one moment of cake cutting with my daughter where she cried because I was there celebrating her birthday or my wife who still stuck around with me despite all my hassles. So I won in life, but realized a lot of this too late. 

Words like values, ethics, mission, vision etc are very useful words that actually have a deep meaning but in management life they are just levers that you can use to further you point and nothing else. 

To all those folks who are doing MBA because you think life is magical after this, realize that it is not. To those who think you can survive without talking to people much and still earn pretty good money and FIRE out of rat race, please correct me and let me know how, I still haven't figured it out. I love economics and have always been following macro trends and realised how this is a losing game. Next venture in my life, farming. Just to keep my hands busy and feed the family.

1lxso5m,Is Admissions Gateway a scam?,"Just got back from an event in Mumbai where I met several admits to top US business schools like Stanford, Wharton, Harvard, and Yale. What started as a casual networking session quickly turned into an eye-opening conversation about one of the most well-known MBA admissions consulting firms, Admissions Gateway.

Despite their aggressive marketing and ‚Äúsuccess stories,‚Äù many of their own clients shared surprisingly negative feedback.

Here‚Äôs what I heard from multiple people:
- Exaggerated and fabricated narratives: Several candidates said they were encouraged, or even pressured, to include false or highly exaggerated stories in their applications. Since US B-schools rarely verify essay content the way they do GMAT scores or transcripts, the firm allegedly takes advantage of this loophole to push made-up achievements that sound impressive but aren‚Äôt grounded in reality.

- Protecting their stats over your dream: Some applicants were told not to apply to schools like Stanford, not because they weren‚Äôt qualified, but because a rejection would hurt the firm‚Äôs acceptance rate. Imagine being told to lower your ambition just to keep someone else‚Äôs metrics intact.

- Loan kickbacks masked as support: The firm also presents itself as helping students secure education loans. In reality, they allegedly receive 1 to 3 percent kickbacks from lenders. On a $200,000 loan, that translates to over ‚Çπ6 crore in quiet profits while posing as student advocates.

- Internal departures raise eyebrows: One of their top consultants reportedly left to start her own practice, possibly due to ethical concerns. That says a lot about what might be happening behind the scenes.

What stood out most was that even the people who had worked with them didn‚Äôt speak positively. The line I heard more than once was, ‚ÄúThis bubble will burst soon.‚Äù

I‚Äôm currently prepping for Grad school since I would love to break into IB/PE. Here is my situation:

- Undergrad from a non-target university (St.Edward‚Äôs University) 

- I transferred to St.Eds from a Community College 

- Bachelor‚Äôs of Business Administration in International Business, minor in Economics (not a heavy degree like a Finance or STEM one) 

- I only have one Internship as a Financial Analyst in a logistics family business 

- not relevant experience besides my current job in the public sector as a Financial Analyst - City of Austin. I have worked in the past my first job as a Financial Aid Assistant (work-study in a community college), then a few months as a Bank Teller, then Financial Analyst Intern, then Legal Assistant, then Junior Accountant, then Accounting Associate III with the City of Austin, and then ny current role Financial Analyst. 

Right now I‚Äôm studying pretty hard for the GRE since I know I need to ace it to compensate my GPA. I‚Äôm aiming for a 320+ 

I‚Äôm a first gen and also hispanic, latino but born in the US and then grew up in Mexico until I was 14, I moved to the US for high school. My parents heard that I needed to live in the US a certain amount of years before college so that I was considered as an In-State student and not Out of State student.

 The thing is that I grew up in Mexico in a small border city and no one really cared or talked about university, everyone in that town usually get a bachelor‚Äôs from the local university or cross the border and enroll in the other local university located in a small border town in the US side, they graduate and usually end up working in their parents business. 

After high school I attended Community College and I really wanted to move to Austin bc I loved the city and I loved the longhorns football team. I would‚Äôve loved to get in to UT Austin, everyone in my friend group didn‚Äôt really care about moving out of the small town and I was the only one ‚Äúdreaming big‚Äù so I applied and got rejected from UT even with a 3.7 GPA.

My second option was St.Edwards which I got accepted and I choose International Business bc at that time I thought it would be a job where I would be traveling a lot, at that time I had Zero knowledge about how the Finance world worked. 

During my time in St.Ed‚Äôs I didn‚Äôt really put in the effort bc at that time I thought, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point on having a good GPA? This is it, is the last level of Education‚Äù oh I was completely wrong. I got to meet and made a lot of friends that went to UT Austin and everyone was studying and trying hard to get internships and that sort of things. 

At St.Eds I made a Friend who she was also from that small town in the border and both of us were confused on why they were worried about not getting internships. In my last year I knew that I wanted to be a Financial Analyst grow and move in to a big bank but oh boy I was never gonna be able to break in to that field. 

When I graduated from undergrad, that‚Äôs when I understood the importance of getting internships and getting involved in school. 

Took me 4 months to land a job after graduation and it was as a Junior Accountant but I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the job, it was in a small staffing company and wasn‚Äôt getting paid enough and none of my coworkers had a degree only me. Worked my self through and managed to land my current role as a Financial Analyst with the city of Austin and now with all the experience and all the things I learned from my mistakes and my naive way of thinking back when I was doing my undergrad, now I‚Äôm trying to pursue an MBA or an MSF so that I can put in my 100% effort and breakthrough IB/PE and accomplish my goal.

My flatmates then were the people I hung out with for the entirety of my four years. I'm also fairly introverted, though I don't really seem like it in person, so can mask fairly decently when I'm out. I do tend to prefer having some space, which is also a part of the reason as to why I decided to find a flat alone. 

I worry that living alone is going to socially isolate me. For anybody who's been through something like this, do you have any ideas on how I can maintain a social life at an MBA while also living alone? This thread also partly worries me because I see so many people talk about being in social hell in their MBA, so I wanted to go in with some tips from people who've been successful at making friends at their program.

1lxgi07,Be Wary Applying with Test Waivers,"I want to start by saying this is all anecdotal and based on my personal experience. I have learned a lot from this sub over the past year, and I am sharing this to give back to the community.

I am pivoting from a career in healthcare and was working a very demanding job when I decided to apply for my MBA. I did not have the time or mental space to prepare for the GRE or GMAT and do well. I barely got my application in for Round 2.

I read a lot of posts with conflicting opinions on test waivers. From what I gathered, applying with a test waiver definitely makes it harder to receive scholarship money. Still, I felt confident that with my profile, I could get accepted and receive some aid at top programs.

Now that my cycle is over, I have a better sense of how things played out.

# My Results (Applied with Test Waivers):

* Ross: Waitlisted ‚Üí Accepted off waitlist with $$$
* Tepper: Accepted with $$
* Cornell: Waitlisted
* UCLA: Waitlisted
* McCombs: Rejected
* USC: Rejected
* Rice: Accepted with $$$
* Simon: Accepted with $$$$

Looking back, I feel extremely blessed to have received an offer from my top choice with good funding. But I also think I left a lot on the table.

For one, I did not apply to any M7 schools because none of them offered test waivers. I also believe the waiver hurt me at a few programs. One school that rejected me told me during the process that test waivers would not affect admission and would only matter for scholarships. But after I was rejected and asked for feedback, they specifically mentioned the lack of a score as a potential issue.

So here is my takeaway. Even with a strong profile, I think it is worth submitting a test score. Whether it is the GMAT, GRE, or Executive Assessment, having something to show helps. You do not need to crush the test. I honestly believe a decent score with a compelling profile is better than a strong profile with no score at all.

Again, this is just my experience. Others may feel differently. But it looks like many COVID-era policies are being rolled back. I think test waivers will still be around, but top schools will likely expect a score moving forward.",1752263328.0,MBA,Business

After three tough and consecutive application cycles, I‚Äôm at a crossroads and could use this community's honest advice on my next steps. I'm not sure if I should gear up for a fourth attempt or if it's time to hang up my boots.

Here's a breakdown of my profile and application history.

**My Profile:**

* **GRE:** 337 (Valid until June 2027)
* **Work Experience:** 8 years in the Retail space across India, Israel, Australia, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Singapore.
   * Worked as a consultant and was part of an Israeli retail-tech startup.
   * For the last 3 years, I've been heading the Post-Sales arm for the startup across the APAC region.
   * Built their regional operations from the ground up, generating $1.1M in revenue in 2.5 years, leading a team of 10 people.
* **GPA:** 6.48/10 (International Student)
* **Extra Coursework:** MBA Math from UC Berkeley Extension.
* **Extracurriculars:**
   * Active in an NGO during and after undergrad.
   * Former national-level basketball player.
   * Host a podcast.
   * Run my own small-scale business in the retail space with US$600k revenue.

# My Goals:

* **Short-Term:** Pivot to Retail Consulting.
* **Long-Term:** Launch my startup in the retail-tech/AI space.

# Application History:

**2022 Cycle:**

* **LBS:** Rejected without interview.
* **INSEAD:** Interviewed -> Waitlisted -> Rejected.
* **HEC Paris:** Accepted (did not join).

**2023 Cycle (Worked with the wrong consultant):**

* **Kellogg:** Rejected without interview.
* **Columbia:** Rejected without interview.
* **Wharton:** Rejected without interview.

**2024 Cycle:**

* **Duke:** Rejected without interview.
* **Darden:** Rejected without interview.
* **Wharton:** Rejected without interview.
* **LBS:** Rejected without interview.
* **INSEAD:** Rejected without interview.
* **Haas:** Rejected without interview.
* **Stern:** Rejected without interview.
* **Tuck:** Interviewed -> Rejected.
* **Ross:** Interviewed -> Rejected.
* **Yale SOM:** Interviewed -> Rejected.
* **Columbia:** Interviewed -> Waitlisted -> Rejected.
* **Kellogg:** Interviewed -> Waitlisted until the very end. I was kept on the WL even after many others were rejected. I visited the campus, attended classes, and showed a ton of interest, but ultimately received a rejection.

I'm figuring out the weak link here. Is it the low GPA? The lack of a big brand name on my resume? My application strategy? Any feedback, no matter how harsh, would be incredibly helpful.

What do you think is missing? Should I try again, and if so, what should I do differently?

1lxefri,"üíº Career Pivot Advice: From Back Office Finance to Client-Facing Roles (Sales, Consulting, Product Mgmt)","Hi,

I‚Äôm looking for some honest guidance and insights as I explore a potential career pivot. I‚Äôve spent the past 8+ years in back office finance/accounting roles, primarily focused on month-end close procedures, journal entries, reconciliations, and financial reporting. While I‚Äôve developed strong analytical skills and a solid understanding of business operations, I‚Äôve realized that I‚Äôm ready for a change.

I recently completed my MBA from Villanova University, and that experience really reinforced my interest in more strategic, cross-functional, and client-facing work. I‚Äôm looking to move into roles such as:

Sales (ideally B2B / solutions-based)
Product or Program Management
Consulting (management, financial, or operations-focused)

What‚Äôs Driving the Pivot:
I genuinely enjoy communicating with people, solving business problems, and thinking bigger picture.
I‚Äôve often been the go-to person for cross-functional coordination and explaining finance concepts to non-financial stakeholders.
I want a faster-paced, more collaborative environment with clear impact and growth opportunities.
The MBA gave me exposure to broader business strategy, leadership, and working on real-world projects with cross-functional teams.

The Challenge:
My resume still leans heavily toward traditional finance and accounting. While I‚Äôve started upskilling (learning about product management, project leadership, and CRM tools), I don‚Äôt yet have formal client-facing experience. I‚Äôm unsure how to break into these new areas without having to start from scratch.

My Questions for You:
1. Has anyone here made a similar pivot? What helped you make the leap?
2. Are there transitional roles or titles I should aim for that could act as a bridge?
3. How do I best tell my story in a way that aligns with what hiring managers in these fields are looking for?
4. Does an MBA (like mine from Villanova) open doors, or is it still critical to get a certification (PMP, Salesforce, etc.) or additional experience first?
5. How do you manage the fear of a lower salary or variable compensation (e.g., commission-heavy roles)? I‚Äôm used to a stable income in finance and want to make sure I understand the risk/reward of these new paths.

Any input‚Äîfrom personal experiences to practical steps‚Äîis truly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help!

I received an offer for Columbia J-term but was already getting everything ready for Kellogg. I've spent way too much time debating between these schools in my head and would love to hear your advice.

For context: I'm W30, from LATAM, T2 consultant, 6YOE, sponsored. What I'm thinking:

1) Brand: I think the Columbia brand is recognized internationally, but in business Kellogg is just as good.

2) Job prospects: I'll go back to consulting. I believe Kellogg is better for this than Columbia. However, I would like to live in NYC so is it better to go to business school in the city where you want to work?  
Also, as it's J-term, no internship.

3) Social: I'm looking for a strong community, apparently Kellogg makes the most sense. But again, I would like to live in NYC after the MBA, so it would be better to meet people around NYC?

4) Visa: I alreade have it with, Kellogg, so I'd have to go through the process again for Columbia.

5) Personal: I would have to wait 6 more months, but probably I would try volunteering rather than continue in consulting.

I have mixed feelings because I worked so hard to get out of Columbia's witlist, so It would be great to hear some experiences about both!

Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm an incoming Indian student at HEC Paris, joining the Master in Management (MiM) program with a strong focus on finance and strategy consulting. While I‚Äôm definitely exploring opportunities across Europe, I‚Äôm particularly interested in breaking into consulting roles in the Middle East.

I‚Äôd really appreciate some guidance on the following:

	1.	How realistic or common is it to break into top consulting roles in the Middle East (MBB, Strategy&, Big 4, etc.) via HEC Paris?


	2.	Do Middle East offices recruit directly on campus, or would I have to network/apply via local channels and referrals?


	3.	Is Arabic proficiency essential, or are English-speaking candidates with a solid academic and internship background still competitive?


Would love to hear from anyone who has made this transition or has insights into the HEC ‚Üí Middle East consulting path. Any advice, strategies, or things to avoid would mean a lot!

Earned a 3.5 GPA in a Canadian biz school certificate

Just admitted to McGill‚Äôs post-grad in Advanced Business Management (to prep for MBA)

I wanted to share something valuable that helped me and could benefit many others who are unsure about their next academic or career step.

Online education has completely evolved. Today, many top universities in India ‚Äî like Manipal, Amity, Jain, Chandigarh, and others ‚Äî are offering UGC-approved online degrees in programs like BCA, MCA, MBA, BA, BCom, and more.

These are not outdated distance learning models. These are fully online programs that offer:

Live and recorded classes

Online assignments and proctored exams

UGC and AICTE recognition (valid for jobs, government exams, and further studies)

Affordable fee structures (some under ‚Çπ1 lakh for the entire course)

The flexibility to study from anywhere, anytime


Why consider online education?

If you can't relocate or attend regular college

If you're working or preparing for competitive exams

If you're looking to gain a degree while managing family responsibilities

If you're on a budget and want to save on hostel or travel expenses


I recently enrolled in an online program myself and now have a clear idea of how the system works from the inside. It's far more organized, interactive, and tech-enabled than I expected.

Important:
Admissions for many July 2025 sessions are closing soon ‚Äî some within the next few days. If you're considering it, this is the right time to act.

If you're confused about which course or university to choose, feel free to comment or message me. I‚Äôm not selling anything ‚Äî just here to help others like me who want to grow and move forward.

1lwg33i,Applying to MBA in R1 from MBB - does MBA brand / alumni network matter long-term if I am returning to consulting afterwards? Weighing up HSW vs. rest of M7.,"Sponsorship is a good deal at my firm so planning on taking it and then pivoting to either PE Ops or corp strategy down the line.

I have family ties to the Midwest so debating focusing all my attention on Kellogg and Booth vs. the HSW or bust mindset that most of my peers have adopted. My thinking is my post-MBA experience at MBB will likely be a bigger part of my brand vs. where I went to school. 

However, I‚Äôm cognizant that the brand value and network at HSW is differentiated - and that this may be salient if trying to recruit for PE Ops. However, I think this would probably be less true for corp strategy - although I could be wrong.

GPA: 3.65 (state school, non-target)

GMAT: 740 (actual)

Age: 30

1lwojzd,Does the future earnings potential of an MBA make it worth it?,"For some context, I‚Äôve seen a few posts about how people are currently in ~200k roles with a lax hour schedule and are looking to get an MBA. The comments usually say not worth it and stay in their current role, but does that apply to future earnings growth as well?

I am in a similar situation, around 200k in total comp in my late 20s and considering a career change. The reasoning is, while my comp is good and the hours aren‚Äôt killer, my max compensation though this career path may level out at around 300k max, with no equity comp or other packages. It may be a bit greedy, but I genuinely want to make more, like a lot more. I see this done the most through becoming a people leader, or tech employees with crazy RSU grants, and going towards either option seems near impossible within the short to medium term (5-7 years) unless I pivot.

I work in personal finance so i understand how painful taking on debt for this can be, but max compensation in roles such as consulting, IB, and strategy have a much higher ceiling to my understanding. Wouldn‚Äôt that make it worth leaving a 200k role now?",1752182321.0,MBA,Business

1lwlgxh,Help me choose between Yale SOM Silver Scholars and Chicago Booth Scholars (Deferred)!!,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on a dilemma I‚Äôm currently facing.

When I was applying to MBA programs, Yale SOM Silver Scholars was my top choice. I don‚Äôt live in the U.S., but my boyfriend does, and being closer to him was a big part of my decision. I also applied to a few other schools simply because I already had the application materials ready.

In May, I was thrilled to get accepted to Yale, but unfortunately, the scholarship is very minimal, close to none. My parents are willing to help cover the first year‚Äôs tuition and costs, but it‚Äôs still a significant financial stretch and I will not be living comfortably in my first year.

As a pleasant surprise, I also got into Booth‚Äôs deferred MBA program. At the time of applying, I didn‚Äôt know much about Booth, but after researching it more (especially before the interview), I realized it could be a great fit, particularly because great finance focus and amazing faculty, etc.

The challenge is: Booth is a deferred offer, so I wouldn‚Äôt be able to move to the U.S. right away, hence maybe letting go of a great relationship and they won‚Äôt finalize any scholarship decisions until the year I enroll. So the financial side is currently unknown.

My plan after the first year at Yale is to recruit for consulting, but I‚Äôve recently seen a lot of mixed reviews about Yale SOM, especially related to recruiting outcomes, and I‚Äôm starting to worry about whether this large upfront investment will be worth it in the long run.

I‚Äôd really appreciate any insights or advice from people. Thank you so much in advance!

1lwhhvu,Reflecting on my first year at an M7 - feeling alone and isolated,"I have just finished my first year at an M7 school and frankly feel miserable. I was expecting a fun-filled two years with lots of development opportunities, and while I have enjoyed the academic elements of the program, the social scene has been terrible for me.  
  
I came into the program from a MF PE firm and was planning on returning to the buy-side post-graduation. However, I have faced constant derision from my classmates over my career choice. I frequently hear how ""private equity is killing American industry"" and that ""PE investors are vultures who destroy companies through financial engineering"". On the other hand, my friends in B4 Audit and Tech are praised for ""actually making a difference"". Faced with a crisis of conscience, I tried to get a referral from a PMM but he rejected me as we apparently weren't close enough.   
  
On that point, I have not been able to connect with my classmates whatsoever. My peers are all obsessed with k-pop and anime whereas I have mainly engaged with Western media. I tried to connect with their¬†interests by listening to BLACKPINK and watching Death Note, but have been written off as 'basic'. I think what hurt most was when I had invited a group of acquaintances to the opening game of our local MLB team with the hopes that our friendship would grow. As I was lining up at the gate asking where people were, I received a text from them telling me that they had changed plans last minute in order to attend the Magic the Gathering: Tarkir Dragonstorm pre-release and that they were ""sure I could find¬†other people to¬†come with me"". This was minutes before the first pitch and left me out several hundred dollars.  
  
Last but not least, the dating scene has sucked. I am tall and white and would be considered by most to be conventionally attractive. I was hoping to find a long-term partner here, but most categorize me as a 'fuck boy' before we even have a serious conversation. I tried to ask out a classmate for coffee, but have heard through the rumor mill that she put me on blast in a group chat for having 'yellow fever'.¬†It's been completely humiliating.¬†¬†  
  
I more or less just wanted to make this post as a warning sign to others who might be considering an MBA. If you're obsessed with prestige and are not into k-pop, anime, and trading card games - it's definitely possible that you'll have a bad time.¬†¬†",1752165724.0,MBA,Business

GMAT: 725

Undergrad: Double degree, business administration and mathematics from a Canadian school that doesn‚Äôt really have much international clout.

1lwjamv,AITA for ditching my racist consultant last minute for a cheaper alternative and causing him to throw a tantrum?,"Apologies if I make any mistakes. English is not my first language. 

I (25F) am planning to pursue an MBA from one of the M7 (won't name the uni as I don't want to get doxxed but it is known for its finance courses). I come from an immigrant family which struggled financially for most part of my life and even being able to afford uni after working and saving up since I was 16 is a big deal for me. 

I decided to hire a consultant (let's call him  T for the sake of this post) because I didn't want to waste a dime of it on a wrong college or a course which didn't suit me or my goals. T had marketed himself as someone who has years of experience in this niche, promised to handle everything, and basically sell me peace of mind in regards of my concerns with uni selection. I went through his reviews and didn't find any red flags so I pretty much believed him. (Catch: BIG MISTAKE)



 He said that since I'm a talented student, he would give me some discount and will settle for ""mere $1350"" minus extra charges for extra sessions if I wanted any. 

We're talking close to $2,000 USD for what felt like a glorified checklist and a few phone calls. 



I took a big chunk out of my savings and paid T a hefty deposit. We had a discussion after my payment and that was the first time I felt like something was off. He was constantly pushing me towards the most expensive options, brushing off my budget concerns, and generally making me feel like I was careless and ""not serious enough"" for my career for thinking about cheaper alternatives. 



Fast forward to two days ago. I was deep in a rabbit hole of research, trying to find alternatives because till then all my red flag alarms had gone off in my head and I knew I wanted to drop his services like a hot potato. That's when I stumbled upon a website really good website which was offering the exact services for like $99. I did lots of background research and turns out they had recently started their services hence giving it for cheaper rates (Not adding their link here as they didn't sponsor me lol, but if you want, I can send it to you on DM). 



So, I knew I had to put up my big girl pants and confront T and tell him that I am not going with his services. I felt unsafe going to his office so decided to do that over a phone call. Not much to my surprise, he dropped his professional facade and called me a bunch of names and even refused to return my money. Things escalated to the point of me having to threaten legal action. 



He went on to spew all the racist shit saying, how ""people like me"" always try to cut corners, are scammers, and cheap people. He even implied that my entire project would fall apart without his ""guidance"" and that I was making a huge mistake. He went on about his cancellation policy and how he wasn't refunding a dime of my deposit because of the ""time already invested.""

But basically title, I'm about to matriculate at an M7 this upcoming fall and I'm worried about revealing the fact that I have a girlfriend of 3 years. Not because I want to cheat, physically nor emotionally nor academically, but I really really hate hanging out with other couples. I've asked my MBA friends and they basically said if you are shacked up you're kind of forced to hang out with other couples all the time, as the single people will be partying.

Now I don't know about you, but if I have to go on one more double date I'm going to blow my brains out. I want to get shitfaced with the boys (while remaining faithful) and not be ostracized by my peers for going out while they all know I'm in a relationship.

On the other end, if I am constantly invited to couple hangouts, my girlfriend will rightfully feel entitled to go with me. I could honestly use the time away from her, unfortunately I didn't land an M7 that would make us long distance, but if I'm invited to non-couples events, I could just say it's networking, this is about as far of a lie as I'm willing to make.

So basically my question is from two angles - one hand I don't want judgement from my classmates for partying while in a relationship, and on the other hand I don't want my girlfriend around me all the time when I could be forming new connections and experiences.
