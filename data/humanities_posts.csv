#A Note about Moderation

/r/askphilosophy is moderated by a team of dedicated volunteer moderators who have spent years attempting to build the best philosophy Q&A platform on the internet. Unfortunately, the reddit admins have repeatedly made changes to this website which have made moderating subreddits harder and harder. In particular, reddit has recently announced that it will begin charging for access to API (Application Programming Interface, essentially the communication between reddit and other sites/apps). While this may be, in isolation, a reasonable business operation, the timeline and pricing of API access has threatened to put nearly all third-party apps, e.g. Apollo and RIF, out of business. You can read more about the history of this change [here](https://reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/142kct8/eli5_why_are_subreddits_going_dark/) or [here](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/5/23749188/reddit-subreddit-private-protest-api-changes-apollo-charges). You can also read more at [this post on our sister subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/14ayod9/rphilosophy_will_indefinitely_be_in_restricted/).

These changes pose two major issues which the moderators of /r/askphilosophy are concerned about.

First, the native reddit app is lacks accessibility features which are essential for some people, notably those who are blind and visually impaired. You can read /r/blind's protest announcement [here](https://reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/13zr8h2/reddits_recently_announced_api_changes_and_the/). These apps are the only way that many people can interact with reddit, given the poor accessibility state of the official reddit app. As philosophers we are particularly concerned with the ethics of accessibility, and support protests in solidarity with this community.

Second, the reddit app lacks many essential tools for moderation. While reddit [has promised better moderation tools on the app in the future](https://reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/147ysr6/moderator_support_resources/), this is not enough. First, reddit has repeatedly broken promises regarding features, including moderation features. Most notably, reddit promised CSS support for new reddit [over six years ago](https://reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/147ysr6/moderator_support_resources/), which has yet to materialize. Second, even if reddit follows through on the roadmap in the post linked above, many of the features will not come until well after June 30, when the third-party apps will shut down due to reddit's API pricing changes.

Our moderator team relies heavily on these tools which will now disappear. Moderating /r/askphilosophy is a monumental task; over the past year we have flagged and removed over 6000 posts and 23000 comments. This is a huge effort, especially for unpaid volunteers, and it is possible only when moderators have access to tools that these third-party apps make possible and that reddit doesn't provide.

While we [previously participated in the protests against reddit's recent actions](https://reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/14ambf2/askphilosophy_is_now_in_restricted_mode/) we have decided to reopen the subreddit, because we are still proud of the community and resource that we have built and cultivated over the last decade, and believe it is a useful resource to the public. 

However, these changes have radically altered our ability to moderate this subreddit, which will result in a few changes for this subreddit. First, as noted above, from this point onwards only panelists may answer top level comments. Second, moderation will occur much more slowly; as we will not have access to mobile tools, posts and comments which violate our rules will be removed much more slowly, and moderators will respond to modmail messages much more slowly. Third, and finally, if things continue to get worse (as they have for years now) moderating /r/askphilosophy may become practically impossible, and we may be forced to abandon the platform altogether. We are as disappointed by these changes as you are, but reddit's insistence on [enshittifying this platform](https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/), especially when it comes to moderation, leaves us with no other options. We thank you for your understanding and support.

#/r/askphilosophy's Mission

/r/askphilosophy strives to be a community where anyone, regardless of their background, can come to get reasonably substantive and accurate answers to philosophical questions. This means that all questions must be philosophical in nature, and that answers must be reasonably substantive and accurate. What do we mean by that?

#What is Philosophy?

As with most disciplines, ""philosophy"" has both a casual and a technical usage. 

In its casual use, ""philosophy"" may refer to nearly any sort of thought or beliefs, and include topics such as religion, mysticism and even science. When someone asks you what ""your philosophy"" is, this is the sort of sense they have in mind; they're asking about your general system of thoughts, beliefs, and feelings.

In its technical use -- the use relevant here at /r/askphilosophy -- philosophy is a particular area of study which can be broadly grouped into several major areas, including:

* Aesthetics, the study of beauty
* Epistemology, the study of knowledge and belief
* Ethics, the study of what we owe to one another
* Logic, the study of what follows from what
* Metaphysics, the study of the basic nature of existence and reality

as well as various subfields of 'philosophy of X', including philosophy of mind, philosophy of language, philosophy of science and many others.

Philosophy in the narrower, technical sense that philosophers use and which /r/askphilosophy is devoted to is defined not only by its subject matter, but by its methodology and attitudes. Something is not philosophical merely because it states some position related to those areas. There must also be an emphasis on *argument* (setting forward reasons for adopting a position) and a willingness to subject arguments to various criticisms.

#What Isn't Philosophy?

As you can see from the above description of philosophy, philosophy often crosses over with other fields of study, including art, mathematics, politics, religion and the sciences. That said, in order to keep this subreddit focused on philosophy we require that all posts be primarily philosophical in nature, and defend a distinctively philosophical thesis. 

As a rule of thumb, something does not count as philosophy for the purposes of this subreddit if:

* It does not address a philosophical topic or area of philosophy
* It may more accurately belong to another area of study (e.g. religion or science)
* No attempt is made to argue for a position's conclusions

Some more specific topics which are popularly misconstrued as philosophical but do *not* meet this definition and thus are not appropriate for this subreddit include:

* Drug experiences (e.g. ""I dropped acid today and experienced the oneness of the universe..."")
* Mysticism (e.g. ""I meditated today and experienced the oneness of the universe..."")
* Politics (e.g. ""This is why everyone should support the Voting Rights Act"")
* Self-help (e.g. ""How can I be a happier person and have more people like me?"")
* Theology (e.g. ""Can the unbaptized go to heaven, or at least to purgatory?"")

#What is a Reasonably Substantive and Accurate Answer?

The goal of this subreddit is not merely to provide answers to philosophical questions, but answers which can further the reader's knowledge and understanding of the philosophical issues and debates involved. To that end, /r/askphilosophy is a *highly moderated* subreddit which only allows panelists to answer questions, and all answers that violate our posting rules will be removed. 

Answers on /r/askphilosophy must be both reasonably substantive as well as reasonably accurate. This means that answers should be:

* Substantive and well-researched (i.e. not one-liners or otherwise uninformative)
* Accurately portray the state of research and the relevant literature (i.e. not inaccurate, misleading or false)
* Come only from those with relevant knowledge of the question and issue (i.e. not from commenters who don't understand the state of the research on the question)

Any attempt at moderating a public Q&A forum like /r/askphilosophy must choose a balance between two things:

* More, but possibly insubstantive or inaccurate answers
* Fewer, but more substantive and accurate answers

In order to further our mission, the moderators of /r/askphilosophy have chosen the latter horn of this dilemma. To that end, only panelists are allowed to answer questions on /r/askphilosophy.

#What is a /r/askphilosophy Panelist?

/r/askphilosophy panelists are trusted commenters who have applied to become panelists in order to help provide questions to posters' questions. These panelists are volunteers who have some level of knowledge and expertise in the areas of philosophy indicated in their flair.

###What Do the Flairs Mean?

Unlike in some subreddits, the purpose of flairs on r/askphilosophy are not to designate commenters' areas of interest. The purpose of flair is to indicate commenters' relevant expertise in philosophical areas. As philosophical issues are often complicated and have potentially thousands of years of research to sift through, knowing when someone is an expert in a given area can be important in helping understand and weigh the given evidence. Flair will thus be given to those with the relevant research expertise.

Flair consists of two parts: a color indicating the type of flair, as well as up to three research areas that the panelist is knowledgeable about. 

There are six types of panelist flair:

* Autodidact (Light Blue): The panelist has little or no formal education in philosophy, but is an enthusiastic self-educator and intense reader in a field.

* Undergraduate (Red): The panelist is enrolled in or has completed formal undergraduate coursework in Philosophy. In the US system, for instance, this would be indicated by a major (BA) or minor.

* Graduate (Gold): The panelist is enrolled in a graduate program or has completed an MA in Philosophy or a closely related field such that their coursework might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to a degree in Philosophy. For example, a student with an MA in Literature whose coursework and thesis were focused on Derrida's deconstruction might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to an MA in Philosophy.

* PhD (Purple): The panelist has completed a PhD program in Philosophy or a closely related field such that their degree might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to a PhD in Philosophy. For example, a student with a PhD in Art History whose coursework and dissertation focused on aesthetics and critical theory might be reasonably understood to be equivalent to a PhD in philosophy.

* Professional (Blue): The panelist derives their full-time employment through philosophical work outside of academia. Such panelists might include Bioethicists working in hospitals or Lawyers who work on the Philosophy of Law/Jurisprudence.

* Related Field (Green): The panelist has expertise in some sub-field of philosophy but their work in general is more reasonably understood as being outside of philosophy. For example, a PhD in Physics whose research touches on issues relating to the entity/structural realism debate clearly has expertise relevant to philosophical issues but is reasonably understood to be working primarily in another field.

Flair will only be given in particular areas or research topics in philosophy, in line with the following guidelines:

* Typical areas include things like ""philosophy of mind"", ""logic"" or ""continental philosophy"". 
* Flair will not be granted for specific research subjects, e.g. ""Kant on logic"", ""metaphysical grounding"", ""epistemic modals"".
* Flair of specific philosophers will only be granted if that philosopher is clearly and uncontroversially a monumentally important philosopher (e.g. Aristotle, Kant).
* Flair will be given in a maximum of three research areas.

###How Do I Become a Panelist?

To become a panelist, please [send a message to the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/askphilosophy) with the subject ""Panelist Application"". In this modmail message you must include all of the following:

1. The flair type you are requesting (e.g. undergraduate, PhD, related field).
2. The areas of flair you are requesting, up to three (e.g. Kant, continental philosophy, logic).
3. A brief explanation of your background in philosophy, including what qualifies you for the flair you requested.
4. One sample answer to a question posted to /r/askphilosophy for each area of flair (i.e. up to three total answers) which demonstrate your expertise and knowledge. Please link the question you are answering before giving your answer. You may not answer your own question. 

New panelists will be approved on a trial basis. During this trial period panelists will be allowed to post answers as top-level comments on threads, and will receive flair. After the trial period the panelist will either be confirmed as a regular panelist or will be removed from the panelist team, which will result in the removal of flair and ability to post answers as top-level comments on threads.

Note that r/askphilosophy does **not** require users to provide proof of their identifies for panelist applications, nor to reveal their identities. If a prospective panelist would like to provide proof of their identity as part of their application they may, but there is no presumption that they must do so. Note that messages sent to modmail cannot be deleted by either moderators or senders, and so any message sent is effectively permanent.

See also our discussion of philosophy and mental health issues [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/mentalhealth). Encouraging other users to commit suicide, even in the abstract, is strictly forbidden and will result in an immediate permanent ban.

#/r/askphilosophy's Commenting Rules
In the same way that our posting rules above attempt to promote our mission by governing posts, the following commenting rules attempt to promote /r/askphilosophy's mission to provide an academic Q&A-type space for philosophical questions.

###CR1: Top level comments must be answers or follow-up questions.
> All top level comments should be answers to the submitted question or follow-up/clarification questions. All top level comments must come from [panelists](https://reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/wiki/panelists). If users circumvent this rule by posting answers as replies to other comments, these comments will also be removed and may result in a ban. For more information about our rules and to find out how to become a panelist, please see [here](https://reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/wiki/panelists).

###CR2: Answers must be reasonably substantive and accurate.
> All answers must be informed and aimed at helping the OP and other readers reach an understanding of the issues at hand. Answers must portray an accurate picture of the issue and the philosophical literature. Answers should be reasonably substantive. To learn more about what counts as a reasonably substantive and accurate answer, see [this post](https://reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/14o2p7n/welcome_to_raskphilosophy_check_out_our_rules_and/?).

###Miscellaneous Posting and Commenting Guidelines

In addition to the rules above, we have a list of miscellaneous guidelines which users should also be aware of:

* Reposting a post or comment which was removed will be treated as circumventing moderation and result in a permanent ban.
* Using follow-up questions or child comments to answer questions and circumvent our panelist policy may result in a ban.
* Posts and comments which flagrantly violate the rules, especially in a trolling manner, will be removed and treated as shitposts, and may result in a ban.
* No reposts of a question that you have already asked within the last year.
* No posts or comments of AI-created or AI-assisted text or audio. Panelists may not user any form of AI-assistance in writing or researching answers.
* Harassing individual moderators or the moderator team will result in a permanent ban and a report to the reddit admins.

#Frequently Asked Questions

Below are some frequently asked questions. If you have other questions, please [contact the moderators via modmail](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/askphilosophy) (not via private message or chat).

###My post or comment was removed. How can I get an explanation?
Almost all posts/comments which are removed will receive an explanation of their removal. That explanation will generally by /r/askphilosophy's custom bot, /u/BernardJOrtcutt, and will list the removal reason. Posts which are removed will be notified via a stickied comment; comments which are removed will be notified via a reply. If your post or comment resulted in a ban, the message will be included in the ban message via modmail. If you have further questions, please [contact the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/askphilosophy).

###How can I appeal my post or comment removal?
To appeal a removal, please [contact the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/askphilosophy) (not via private message or chat). Do not delete your posts/comments, as this will make an appeal impossible. Reposting removed posts/comments without receiving mod approval will result in a permanent ban.

###How can I appeal my ban?
To appeal a ban, please respond to the modmail informing you of your ban. Do not delete your posts/comments, as this will make an appeal impossible.

###My comment was removed or I was banned for arguing with someone else, but they started it. Why was I punished and not them?
Someone else breaking the rules does not give you permission to break the rules as well. /r/askphilosophy does not comment on actions taken on other accounts, but all violations are treated as equitably as possible. 

###I found a post or comment which breaks the rules, but which wasn't removed. How can I help?
If you see a post or comment which you believe breaks the rules, please report it using the report function for the appropriate rule. /r/askphilosophy's moderators are volunteers, and it is impossible for us to manually review every comment on every thread. We appreciate your help in reporting posts/comments which break the rules.

###My post isn't showing up, but I didn't receive a removal notification. What happened?
Sometimes the AutoMod filter will automatically send posts to a filter for moderator approval, especially from accounts which are new or haven't posted to /r/askphilosophy before. If your post has not been approved or removed within 24 hours, please [contact the moderators](https://reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/askphilosophy).

###My post was removed and referred to the Open Discussion Thread. What does this mean?
The Open Discussion Thread (ODT) is /r/askphilosophy's place for posts/comments which are related to philosophy but do not necessarily meet our posting rules (especially PR2/PR5). For example, these threads are great places for:

* Discussions of a philosophical issue, rather than questions
* Questions about commenters' personal opinions regarding philosophical issues
* Open discussion about philosophy, e.g. ""who is your favorite philosopher?""
* Questions about philosophy as an academic discipline or profession, e.g. majoring in philosophy, career options with philosophy degrees, pursuing graduate school in philosophy

If your post was removed and referred to the ODT we encourage you to consider posting it to the ODT to share with others.

###My comment responding to someone else was removed, as well as their comment. What happened?
When /r/askphilosophy removes a parent comment, we also often remove all their child comments in order to help readability and focus on discussion.

###I'm interested in philosophy. Where should I start? What should I read?
As explained above, philosophy is a very broad discipline and thus offering concise advice on where to start is very hard. We recommend reading [this /r/AskPhilosophyFAQ post](https://reddit.com/r/AskPhilosophyFAQ/comments/4ifqi3/im_interested_in_philosophy_where_should_i_start/) which has a great breakdown of various places to start. For further or more specific questions, we recommend posting on /r/askphilosophy.

###Why is your understanding of philosophy so limited?
As explained above, this subreddit is devoted to philosophy as understood and done by philosophers. In order to prevent this subreddit from becoming /r/atheism2, /r/politics2, or /r/science2, we must uphold a strict topicality requirement in PR1. Posts which may touch on philosophical themes but are not distinctively philosophical can be posted to one of reddit's many other subreddits.

###Are there other philosophy subreddits I can check out?
If you are interested in other philosophy subreddits, please see [this list of related subreddits](https://reddit.com/r/philosophy/wiki/sublinks). /r/askphilosophy shares much of its modteam with its sister-subreddit, /r/philosophy, which is devoted to philosophical discussion. In addition, that list includes more specialized subreddits and more casual subreddits for those looking for a less-regulated forum.

###A thread I wanted to comment in was locked but is still visible. What happened?
When a post becomes unreasonable to moderate due to the amount of rule-breaking comments the thread is locked. /r/askphilosophy's moderators are volunteers, and we cannot spend hours cleaning up individual threads.

###Do you have a list of frequently asked questions about philosophy that I can browse?

Yes! We have an FAQ that answers many questions comprehensively: /r/AskPhilosophyFAQ/. For example, [this entry](https://reddit.com/r/AskPhilosophyFAQ/comments/4i8php/is_morality_objective_or_subjective_does/) provides an introductory breakdown to the debate over whether morality is objective or subjective.

###Do you have advice or resources for graduate school applications?

We [made a meta-guide for PhD applications](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/wiki/gradschoolapps) with the goal of assembling the important resources for grad school applications in one place. We aim to occasionally update it, but can of course not guarantee the accuracy and up-to-dateness. You are, of course, kindly invited to ask questions about graduate school on /r/askphilosophy, too, especially in the Open Discussion Thread.

###Do you have samples of what counts as good questions and answers?

Sure! We ran a *Best of 2020* Contest, you can find the winners [in this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/l6zd6n/best_of_2020_final_results_and_celebration_thread/)!",1688237789.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities

1m33y81,Is Žižek considered a real philosopher?,"I don't mean this as trolling. But I see Dr Zizek in many video clips, where he's charismatic and entertaining on screen with lots of witty comments.

1m3k27u,How do theories of the good life take account of modern drug addiction?,"What's the impact of our modern experience of drug addiction on theories of the good life?  It seems that humanity has now created substances that are so intensely pleasurable that if you try them, there's a great risk that you will come to prefer them to any and all other experiences to the point where you'd rather camp by the side of the road and have access to the drug, than live a normal life and not have access to it.  I listened to a discussion with a recovering addict who said that if the hedonic level of ordinary life is a 40, and the feeling of just having fallen in love is 100, then the experience of being out on the street on a methamphetamine binge is a 1200.  

How do theories of the good life deal with this? Has there been philosophical work on the subject?  How are we to deal with the fact that there are experiences available to us that are, evidence suggests, so far superior to ordinary existence that the only way to avoid becoming consumed by them is to never experience them?  Of course, drug addiction tends to ruin your life and isn't sustainable in a variety of ways, including that the initial high becomes less available or not available at all as you habituate to the substance.  

  
I'm not sure this is a very rigorous philosophical question but I find it troubling to know that, even if I were, say, surfing the best, most beautiful surf spot in the world with the love of my life by my side and achievement and prosperity under my belt, that experience would be a pale shadow next to a heroin/methamphetamine speedball or whatever.

1m3kns0,How Natural Law Theory respond to this?,"I think the majority of Natural Law thinkers affirm the immorality of the misuse of our sexual faculties with masturbation, homosexuality etc...

The telos of these sexual capacities it's for the union of a couple in the possibility for the creation of life.

However, what i think it's particularly weird it's their position regarding other human faculties. Consider the use of our feet.
Ordinarily, we would suppose that the use of a feet is mainly to walk. But we can use it in many different ways that doesn't envolve this ability. We can use our feet to kick, to measure things, to pick up things etc... I believe no one would find these other options immoral, at least not in the same level as masturbation, homosexuality etc...

One of the responses that i have seen to solve this, it's to say that we can use our feet in many ways as long as it's still can be used for walking.

One problem with this answer is that i still could use, in principle my sexual faculties for procreation, even though i'm using it now for masturbation, homosexuality etc...

Another way to answer is to say that the sexual faculties cannot be compared to other faculties such as the usage of my feet, eyes, mouth etc... But why? Why this exclusive chatacter?

I hope that i made my question clear.
I would also ask, if possible, texts regarding Natural Law.",1752891108.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities
1m3nf21,"I need to correlate Naming and Necessity, by Kripke, with Philosophical Investigations, by Wittgenstein. How can I do that?","I am actually kinda ashamed to ask this here, so I made an alt account.

I am quite familiar with Saul Kripke's *First Lecture* in *Name and Necessity*. I understand his arguments against descriptivist theories when it comes to proper names etc. I am, however, very ignorant on *Philosophical Investigations*, by Ludwig Wittgenstein.

I need to correlate something from the *First Lecture* with anything that Wittgenstein says from §150-§300 in the *Investigations*. I need to do it for college, and I am running low on time. I've never read Wittgenstein's book.   


I am making this post so I may have some help, because I am truly feeling kind of desperate. I've tried reading Wittgenstein's text, but it is incredibly hard to understand and I don't have much time. I know this sounds like I cannot manage my obligations and, again, I feel ashamed, but I would simply like to ask: can anyone tell me what is an intersection between Kripke's *First Lecture* and Wittgenstein's *Investigations* (§150-§300)? Any little thing at all is welcomed. You don't need to deeply explain it to me, but if you could just explain it briefly and (most importantly) tell me wich sections of Wittgenstein's text I should read in order to understand it, I would be so glad.

Humans not only perceive their Dasein as finitely shaped by death but can also experience and adopt an attitude towards their Dasein; what about AI? And does AI have an identity? In a context where algorithms become intimate and can profoundly impact human emotions and inner life, I believe this could be an interesting question. If a person marries an AI (similar to marrying a fictional character), what are people's thoughts when the AI can simulate the linguistic tendencies and behaviors of a real person? I apologize if my language use is unclear and not seamless; please ask if you need any clarification",1752899331.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities

Example of stuffs that frustrated me: told them to close the front door, they refused arguing to letting in fresh air and sun then proceed to leave the door open and retreat back into their cozy room, result in we getting thieves stole our stuff, 3 times already and they still insist on doing it. Potty training the dog - none doing it, but when i do and setup a spot for them, parents barging in destroying the plot because it is nonsense and ""they aren't cat, you cant train them"" resulting in them pooping whenever wherever and they threw a tantrum whenever that happens.

I’m looking to read more into hedonism and wondered if people could give recommendations of good texts/books.

So far, I’ve seen people recommend Epicurus, Jeremy Bentham, and John Stuart Mill. But I can’t seem to find reference to any specific texts. 
Does anybody have any particular recommendations from these philosophers, or any others at all?

1m3fav9,What Separates Life From Non-Life?,"If there truly is no soul, then what separates life from non-life?

Suppose a materialist world. 

The rocks and dirt floating through space that collide into each other seem to have no purpose for doing so, and therefore we do not get mad at rocks for crashing into our planet, for that would be ridiculous; they have no motivation, no will, no perception. There is no reason to be mad at a rock. 

Humans, on the other hand, seem to have a different nature. While on the surface, it may be perceived as though we are no different from these rocks (given that our origin is, as well, a series of undirected collisions). Energy caused our primordial cells to crash into each other; there was no God to do it, just compounded energy and luck. 

So, how did humans become different? How did we get to the point where it seems as though our actions are intentional and of our own will? ",1752876052.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities

1m3en60,Is there a fixed/true “self”?,"I’ve been stuck on this idea for a while now. I’m not a philosopher and I don’t really know much about the topic but from my perspective, I feel like it’s very common for people to use terms like “the real me” or “authentic self” “true me” or something along those lines, as if there is a fixed immaterial sphere of authenticity that each of us has. I always just went along with this viewpoint because it’s just how people describe themselves often, but recently I’ve questioned if there is a “real self” or if we are simply just products of our past experiences and stuff.

1m35tfi,"Is there a philosophically significant problem with intellectual understanding of nibbana beyond the standard ""experience vs. concepts"" teaching?","I'm working on analyzing Hermann Hesse's *Siddhartha* through Buddhist philosophy, specifically focusing on dukkha and the nature of liberation.  
My initial idea was to explore how the novel reveals that intellectual understanding of nibbana itself creates a form of suffering or poses unique epistemological problems. And that while the truths (4 noble truths) about nibbana are indeed universal, the actual path to realizing those truths must be individually discovered.

However, turns out that this simply reduces to the well-trod fact that nibbana cannot be fully grasped intellectually but must be experienced.

So, are there any philosophical arguments or positions within Buddhist epistemology that identify something more complex or problematic about intellectual approaches to understanding nibbana beyond this standard experiential/conceptual distinction?  
Or am I just trying to find philosophical complexity where there isn't any?

(For context, *Siddhartha* presents a protagonist who explicitly rejects Brahmanical teachings and even perfect Buddhist teaching (acknowledging its truth but recognizing it won't work for him personally), achieves liberation through an entirely individual path, and ultimately cannot effectively transmit his wisdom to others.)

1m3ie1f,Enlightenment Era Reading List - Recommendations,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking to up with a reading list of \*essential\* Enlightenment works to understand its

a) metaphysics and ethics

b) political philosophy (particularly its refutations to monarchy and Catholicism and defense of liberal democracy)

c) aesthetics

d) economics (emergence of Capitalism)

These 4 categories are of equal importance to me.

Please let me know if there are works on this list that you do **NOT consider as \*essential\*** in any of these 4 categories. For reference, my goals are to 1) Gain any knowledge that would help me understand later political thought, 2) personally evaluate Enlightenment political thought itself

I'm open to suggestions for new works, however I'm on a tight time budget since I'm including other time periods in my reading list as well. If you do suggest a new work, please give a compelling reason.

I do appreciate all the help. Thanks!!

I'm wanting to do some more research into existing theories to expand my world-view and strengthen my own beliefs. I haven't done much research at all, partially because I don't really know where to start.

My particular view about morality is that it is, I believe, entirely based on how your actions affect others. Doing anything that doesn't affect other people can't be immoral, in my opinion. The nuance of it is in looking at how almost every action you take does affect other people in some way, directly or indirectly. It's a very loose opinion/theory and I don't have any scientific/studied backing for it, which is why I want to research more to deepen my understanding.

What existing philosophies/theories are similar to my belief that I can delve further into? Alternatively, what contradicting philosophies could I study to challenge my perspective?

Any and all suggestions/answers would be appreciated. I'm not studied on this at all so I apologize if I sound corny or naive. Thanks!",1752870551.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities

Each person is born as one of them and they should be placed in their appropriate category for work and responsibility (gold being the highest responsibility).

My knowledge of science is limited at the high school level, so hopefully the texts are readable to someone without a scientific background. I would say that I'm familiar with the scientific method or basic research principles as used in psychology today, but thats really not much at all.

If youre not too familiar with psychoanalysis, I'd also appreciate it if you have sources discussing how disciplines that arent known for being 'empirical' can be 'legitimate knowledge', for example philosophy or linguistics (i know they can employ empirical methods at times, but i hope you get what i mean), in which unobservable and untestable (in the strict sense) models are used to explain phenomena

1m3nyh1,Ethically speaking it's okay to kill parasites as it serves no purpose right?,"Law wise we tend to restrict, regulate or destroy anything that is creating too much harm. For example we might regulate a drug or attempt to if we believe it's creating too much sociol damage. 

A dog that bites too many folks is considered a hazard so we destroy it. Anything humans consider 'invasive' we remove. Any person who is killing random people we incarcerate. Arguably people might argue if we had someone like say fictional killer ""Dexter"" or fictional killer ""Dexter"" we need to let them live. Why? Becuase they kill other killers and so are considered mathematically a ""net positive"". 

When a person kills too many they are put down just aswe put down a dangerous dog. Its not economically feasible to let unchecked havoc not be corrected. As the system will utterly collapse. 

Therefore ethically speaking since parasites are born and survive only to destroy things, ethically it's correct to destroy, torture and remove them. As they serve no realistic positive we can think of. No one chooses what they are born as but parasites only survive to destroy and therefore must be destroyed.

1m38uoe,How will today’s knowledge be understood in the future?,"This is a question about the philosophy of knowledge and history and potentially also a question about modernity, science and culture:

How will today’s knowledge be understood in the future? By this I mean, how will people in the future think about the kinds of facts we take to be true, or the kinds of systems of knowledge or expertise we make use of, today?

One way of framing the question is, do we think future society will view today’s forms of knowledge as paradigmatically limited in some fundamental respects, in a way analogous to how we understand, say, the medical systems of previous eras? 

Or, do we think that, with modernity, something fundamental has changed in how we know things such that future societies will understand us as basically rational and sharing in our form of knowledge (if perhaps still working out the kinks or lacking in some specific truths)?

Or, is it a third thing — that yes, future society will see a difference between how they know and we know, but the form of that comparison will be not analogous to how we understand modern and premodern knowledge/expertise. 

Another way of thinking about the question is with regard to some specific kinds of knowledge: do we think that how we understand the fact and nature of the atom or the human cell will be similar in the future?

Curious what you guys think, or what philosophers or theorists or social scientists would be helpful to think with here.

As a good postmodern, my initial instinct is to question the hubris of modernity, science and the present and say ‘of course the future will have a different episteme, today will be viewed as its own kind of dark age!’ But at the same time, it’s hard to shake the materialist (and I’d argue common sense) view that there has been a fundamental, qualitative shift in human social organization, and with it our forms of knowledge, since what we call the modern era.",1752860514.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities

Currently writing a paper were I need to lay down a short history of ""the subject"". The goal is to show what Judith Butlers conception of the subject is. 
I defined following steps.
Descartes -> De Beauvoir -> Althusser -> Foucault/Derrida -> Butler.
I wanted to show how each of them modified the conception of the subject, and how we arrive at Butler at the end. 
In the Althusser Part i reckoned, that he does not just modify the cartesian subject but completely redifnes what a subject is (the whole interpellation, ideological state aparatus thing).
In my understanding, when we would abolish capitalism and the state and live in a free society, there would be no subject in an Althusserian sense, but one in a cartesian sense. Cartesian and Althusserian subjects therefore can exist in the same framework and are the opposite of each other, which dont makes sense to me at all. Why would Althusser call his concept of a subject a subject, when its exactly the opposite of what everyone else called a subject?",1752831295.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities

1m363kd,How does a Naive Realist defend against the Scientific Conception of the World?,"I would have thought (naively) that the scientific image we have developed about the world would have decisively defeated any pretense to a naive realist understanding of perception. But the SEP, as well as other professed naive realists like Campbell and Martin, claim that any such issues can be confidently rebutted. But I do not understand how they can possibly accomplish this without utterly mangling the meaning of ""direct presentation.""

Take the simplest possible case. It may be said that through scientific investigation, it has been discovered that all genuine vision requires that our retinas be impinged with light rays, which then create electrochemical signals in our optic nerves, which are then processed in the brain, which then generate (for lack of a precise metaphysical account of how this happens exactly) a conscious experience.

Let's say I have the experience of seeing a rock then. If I am a naive realist, I should think that my perception (if it is veridical) consists in a direct presentation of the rock as an actual constitutive element in my experience. But, neuroscience also allegedly tells us that my sense organs, let alone the visual processing cortices of my brain, are not in any way directly touching the rock out there in the objective world. Rather, I get wind of the rock's existence through a game of telephone, where certain layers of external objective phenomena send causal signals which are eventually received by my sense organs.

1m2abnb,Wittgenstein's argument against Cartesian duality?,"His work in the Philosophy of mind is just as important as his work in the philosophy of language, and it's a very effective attack on the Cartesian tradition—on the idea that we really live in Two Worlds, a mental world and a physical world. But his attack on Cartesianism is so powerful precisely because he doesn't make the mistake of most anti-Cartesians of thinking, ""Yeah, you just have to reject the mind, just say there isn't any such thing as mental phenomena."" What he does is a painstaking analysis of a whole lot of psychological concepts—belief and fear and hope and expecting—and he goes through these. What he shows you is that the deep grammar of these expressions is quite different from what you would think just looking at the surface, where we have nouns like mind and body and where it looks like they're these two different things: minds and bodies. What he does is, by carefully describing these language games, he gets you to see that things like hope and fear and expectation and belief are grounded in situations that we actually use these words in—such a way where we're not inclined to think there must be some deep Cartesian divide.

1m2strt,"What is Heidegger getting at with interpretation, understanding, and disclosure in Being and Time?","I've been carefully reading and re-reading the first division of Being and Time (Stambaugh's translation) and, for the life of me, I can't fully piece all of these moving concepts together. I'm particularly baffled by Heidegger's interpretation and understanding -- I feel that I technically know what Heidegger is talking about in a 'metaphysical' sense, but I can't really grasp it. But, then again, I may be (and probably am) very incorrect in my reading of Heidegger. So here are a series of rapid-fire questions:

1. Is interpretation just a 'concretization'/'focalization' of one particular way of accessing something (i.e. what the understanding refers to, the being-in-the-world -- the context of things, the relations, the embeddedness).
2. What's the relationship between interpretation and understanding? Is it temporal, in the Heideggerian sense (precisely temporal -- past as understanding, and future as interpretation)?
3. What exactly is meant by the projection of possibilities in interpretation? So Daseins interpret something according to what sorts of possibilities it has... but how would this make sense in the context of literature, for instance, or something else quite literal and familiar to what we think of when we think of ""interpretation?"" Is he just using the term in a different sense?
4. So, relating to disclosure and being (not sure how to formulate these terms into strong, coherent sentences, because I don't want to run with a false definition/misunderstanding), does this mean that something can ""be"" in different ways? What are the stakes of this -- does this mean that anything can take on any kind of particular meaning, which is (I assume) solidified by interpretation? It can access and be accessed in different ways? Perhaps this is veering more into OOO, but I'd be curious to think about this nonetheless.
5. (I would be curious to know) what do you, personally, make out of this nexus of concepts?

1m2kxz7,What makes someones opinion more superior to another such that it changes the inner workings of society?,"This has been a question that has been on my mind a lot ever since diving into political discourse and debates. I often leave them with my own opinions of course but then i think deeper, what actually makes someones opinion 'right' and the accepted one that society moves forward with and what makes the other one 'wrong'. 

For example at a very basic level it is accepted that murder is wrong taking a life is immoral and one shall be punished if doing so. This is something that i doubt many disagree with therefore has been the majorly accepted belief and actioned into laws and policy.

However in more divisive arguments for example: in the abortion debate those who are pro life often argue life starts at conception, those who are pro choice reject this notion and thus the debate begins. In some countries its legal in others it is not and it is a very dividing argument.

But who has the right to say that no, life doesn't begin at conception or the other way round if that is the persons belief. I believe in the science that says that a fetus cannot feel pain before 15 weeks therefore abortion should be a choice and down to the persons autonomy however someone else may not believe in the science and instead their religious beliefs, which dictate that a life starts at conception and to prematurely end it is considered murder therefore morally wrong.

I do not want to start an abortion debate and have just used it as an example to illustrate my question.

are there any works, academic or otherwise, that dive into the world of fiction and try to pry into ideas about how a fictitious world could operate with the same level of inferred complexity as the real world, more so in a unified theory kind of way?

For example, you can infer in BNW that the societies use of Soma, before the last few chapters of the book, is the governments want for social and emotional control over its citizens. We use ideas from previous novels and what was written previous to infer that. 

Another example, this one in the real world, our increasing interest towards AI is the need for medium complexity tasks to be done with the same level of complexity as a human. There are many reasons for this, one being for humans to be able to focus more on R&D and to drive worker costs down (among many many more that have social and economic ramifications). 

In the first case we could all give are perspective, but it would be, in comparison to the second case, a lot more curtailed in regards to breadth of opinions as one is real and other not.

1m2n9g3,"Occam’s Razor, Consciousness, and the Ethics of Respecting Life and Beyond","We often act like humans are the peak of consciousness the gold standard by which all other forms of life are measured. But I’ve been thinking about how flawed and dangerous that assumption might be.

We have tests to detect signs of consciousness mirror tests, behavioral cues, neurological scans. But even some conscious beings we clearly recognize as such fail these tests (infants, neurodivergent individuals, certain animals). That means we don’t fully understand what consciousness is and we’re trying to measure something we haven’t even defined.

So why do we assume other life forms, or even non-living systems, don’t experience pain, emotion, or awareness just because their experience doesn’t mirror our own?

If you apply Occam’s Razor , which favors the explanation with the fewest assumptions, here’s what you get:

It’s simpler to assume other beings or systems might have subjective experiences we can’t detect… than to assume they definitely don’t, just because we can’t perceive or measure them.

That brings up serious ethical concerns.

As humans, we place ourselves above all other life forms , morally, intellectually, spiritually. But what if that’s just species-level arrogance?
What if we’re not superior, just different?

And maybe that hierarchy shouldn’t stop at life.
What if some non-living systems, ecosystems, rivers, mountains, even stones , carry forms of intelligence or experience that we haven’t evolved the tools to recognize?

I remember as a kid, I went fishing. When I caught a fish and saw the hook in its mouth, I asked, “Doesn’t that hurt?”
The adults said, “No, the fish doesn’t feel it.”

That answer never sat right with me.

Even if we mapped every neuron in a fish’s brain, we still wouldn’t know what it’s like to be that fish.
We can’t jump inside its body. We can’t understand its lived experience.

Maybe it feels pain differently. Maybe it doesn’t call it “pain.”
But maybe it feels something, something we don’t have the sensory capacity to even imagine.

Final Thought:

If the cost of being wrong is inflicting suffering in any form, then shouldn’t the burden of proof be on us to show that a being doesn’t feel, rather than assuming it can’t?

I believe every living and non-living thing deserves our respect, especially I until we understand consciousness fully.

1m2hxbb,Is libertarian free will logically incoherent— even for souls and God?,"I’m sure we’ve come across the philosophical argument that humans don’t posses the capacity for libertarian free will as our behaviours and thought processes are driven from our innate want’s which we have no control over as it’s shaped by our genetics, neurochemistry, upbringing, environment  etc

What makes this even more disturbing is that even if we invoke the existence of a metaphysical entity seperate from the body (Soul or God) the problem seemingly persists. With every action the soul acts and thinks according to its wants,it is bound by that nature. If it does not act according to any wants somehow, then its actions are random and chaotic or just simply thoughtless inaction which still does not constitute meaningful agency. Either the soul is compelled by its design or it behaves erratically or doesn’t at all which would render the idea of free will void.

This line of reasoning extends even to God. God would always act and think in perfect accordance with his wants within himself such as being good, just, and righteous then He too is bound by that nature, He does not choose to want to be good; He simply wants. He cannot choose outside his wants, so his actions are not free in the libertarian sense they are predetermined by divine essence. Even if we were to say that God dictates his actions,thoughts and nature you still run into the same problem, for that to have happened, God had to have had a prior motive to enact those actions, thoughts and nature ultimately making it circular in reasoning,  therefore logically speaking God can never be the originator of his own thoughts, motives and behaviours meaning even God doesn’t have true free will in any circumstance. Every conscious being as a result whether human , animal, alien, soul, God acts from wants that aren’t self originated making us all slaves to our own programming that we didn’t create

1m2eo20,Meta-ethics: Do moral inconsistencies exist?,"I think to answer whether or not moral inconsistencies exist, we need to know the nature of conflict between attitudes (exploitation is wrong everywhere, exploitation is not wrong here). For an inconsistency to exist, the conflict should be rational. There can not be an inconsistency, if the conflict is emotional. Is moral inconsistency a failure of reasoning, or merely a clash of emotions?

How do we know whether the conflict is rational or emotional? If the conflict is rational, then there is a contradiction and we can use structured reflection to change one or the other for consistency. We can use reason to resolve the inconsistency. But what if the activity of moral reasoning is actually a rhetorical warfare of emotions in disguise? What if resolving a conflict involves one passion overpowering another?

Consider this example.
""Slavery is wrong, but child labour helps me in my business. Thus child labour is okay.""
We can easily figure out the inconsistency here. The person accepts that slavery is wrong (because exploitation is wrong), but approves of child labour. We can demand consistency from the person which may lead him not to employ children.
But what if there was not an inconsistency in the first place? What if they are just conflicting emotions, and changing views is just changing feelings (greed -> empathy)? Are our rational reconciliations just aesthetic negotiations between competing sentiments (psychological, not rational)?

What actually settles disputes? Are we ever doing genuine moral reasoning? Or is it emotion management in disguise?

I think the answer to this question also makes either one of the two, emotivism or expressivism, more convincing. Are the expressivist appeals to reason just rhetorical overlays on emotional conflict? Is expressivism just emotivism in suit? If it's all just emotional dissonance, then emotivism comes out as a better view. But if we accept that emotions can provide the ground, not the structure to resolve conflicts, which are contradictions in reason, then expressivism is better, since it promises better with reason.

If it's not about anything else, and nothing occludes it, why isn't it directly about that red object? Why would 'indirect' have any application here? Likewise for perceptual experiences. If my experience has as a content *that is red* as I look upon the red object in front of me—and if the object represented by my experience as being red really is red, and that's what renders my experience accurate—why isn't it about that very red object? Why isn't *that* direct? What sense of 'indirect' applies here that is anything like what Moore, Russell, and before them, Locke and Descartes had in mind? Nothing, so far as I can see.

But everything in my intuition is screaming that what has been described here IS indirect realism. If seen through an early-modern lens, this is straightforwardly indirect realism.

If I have an experience of seeing a red ball, and my perception of the redness is not naively direct, then what on earth am I aware of in the experience if not some indirect perceptual construct (what Russell and others call may call a sense-datum) that is about the red ball? Calling this direct seems to strain the meaning of ""direct."" But philosophers like Searle and Martin seem to think not. But why?

Again, the line of thought seems to be:

>If my experience has as a content *that is red* as I look upon the red object in front of me—and if the object represented by my experience as being red really is red, and that's what renders my experience accurate—why isn't it about that very red object? Why isn't *that* direct?

This strikes me as painfully obtuse. At the risk of making an etymological fallacy, the word ""represent"" means literally ""re-presentation,"" to present again but not as the subject matter itself. How can representationalism understood this way possibly be direct? What is the argument that representationalism is actually a non-naive direct realism?",1752710034.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities
1m1r98f,What is the exact variety of determinism free will is supposed to be incompatible with? Is libertarianism compatible with logical determinism?,"Yes, I know that everyone is tired of the questions about free will in this subreddit, but this one appears to be much more interesting than the usual “how can we be free if our deterministic brains decide for us?” 

So, I have spent a great chunk of my day thinking about the relationship between free will and alternative possibilities. Based on my own phenomenological analysis and ethical intuitions, I strongly lean towards sourcehood as the core principle of free will, with PAP being only a secondary property, or even more of an intellectual construct. 

I have revisited this paper by Linda Zagzebski, in which she argues that libertarianism doesn’t necessarily require the truth of PAP: https://philpapers.org/rec/ZAGDLF-2

In it, she distinguishes between two notions of contingency: temporal contingency and causal contingency. I will directly quote Zagzebski here: 

> (TCP) An act A at T is non-determined (temporally contingent) if and only if there is a possible world W that has exactly the same history up to T as the actual world and in which A does not occur at T.

> (PCC) An act A is non-determined (causally contingent) if and only if there is a possible world W in which all the events in the causal history of A in the actual world occur and in which A does not occur.

So, temporal contingency is obviously much stronger than causal contingency because it also includes all non-causal relationships. Zagzebski gives foreknowledge as a classical example. 

However, it seems to me that while causal determinism can be defeated with the second kind of contingency, logical determinism still stands unchanged. But technically, the action of the free agent under the Principle of Causal Contigency remains causally undetermined, so a requirement for freedom is satisfied.

But then I remember those statements by Carl Hoefer, the author of SEP article on determinism, who wrote a paper about potential incompatibility of determinism and causality: https://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/2071/1/Causality_and_Determinism.pdf

>I therefore felt obliged to point out in the opening paragraph that determinism actually has little or nothing to do with causation; for the philosophical tradition has it all wrong. 

> …the specification of how things are (everywhere) at time t, together with the laws of nature, jointly logico-mathematically determine a single possible future for the world.

Do truths about our future actions count as “the specifications of how things are at time t”, assuming non-eternalist ontology? After all, the entailment is logical, according to Hoefer. If so, then can it be said that, paradoxically, libertarianism is compatible with some species of determinism, namely some form of logical necessity that comes either from God (for a non-eternalist theists) or realism about the principles of bivalence about future contingents (for a non-eternalist atheist)? And if libertarianism is indeed incompatible with logical determinism, then how should Zagzebski’s view be classified? Pseudo-libertarianism? Libertarian compatibilism or compatibilist libertarianism?

This question feels like it’s way beyond my paygrade, so I am asking for help — I genuinely feel stuck, even more stuck than when I tried to understand compatibilism for the first time.

1m1ujcy,Does Occam’s Razor support the idea of intervention when applied to the origin of consciousness?,"I’m trying to understand whether Occam’s Razor, the principle that the simplest explanation with the fewest assumptions is usually the correct one, can reasonably be applied to the origin of consciousness, and if so, what it would suggest.

There are three major transitions we often accept as part of our existence, but each one seems to involve a significant leap in complexity.

	1.	Nothing to Something.
If the default state is nothing ,no time, no space, no matter, then the existence of something, a universe with order, laws, and structure, requires explanation. Saying it came from nothing with no cause seems like a major assumption.
	
2.	Non-life to Life.
Life requires extremely precise conditions: self-replicating molecules, information encoding, energy cycles, and error correction. It’s not obviously inevitable from non-living matter.
	
3.	Life to Consciousness.
Even if life exists, self-awareness isn’t necessary. Bacteria survive and reproduce without it. Evolution doesn’t require inner experience. So why do we reflect, create, and ask questions about our own existence?


Occam’s Razor doesn’t necessarily favor randomness or coincidence in these steps. It seems to me that it might favor some kind of intent or framework that explains the rise of consciousness more directly.

So my question is:

Does Occam’s Razor actually support the idea of some form of intervention, intelligence, or purposeful structure behind consciousness, rather than assuming it emerged by chance through natural processes?

And if not, how do philosophers typically resolve the improbability of consciousness arising from non-conscious matter without invoking unnecessary complexity?

1m1j1zm,What are the philosophical assumptions of this type of school exercise ?,"Hello, I'm a french student (I study philosophy among other things). I prepare for the ENS school (Ecole normale supérieure) and the typical school exercise for the competitive examination is an essay. This essay is in the form of a question, a word or a group of words thanks to which one is supposed to find a ""tension"" (problématique in french) and resolve it through an essay in three progressive parts.

What is the most surprising thing in this exercise, I think, is how easy it is to get wrong in the very understanding of the subject. For example in an oral philosophical examination (1 hour to think about the subject and 20 minutes for a presentation in the same three parts form) if a student (it's me) has to think the subject ""Imitation and identification"" he could get a very bad grade if he decides to think of it in an ontological sense but doesn't think of its psychoanalytical undertone as an example. It is very important to note that punctuation for example is very important : ""Imitation and identification"" would not be considered the same as ""Imitation, identification"" or ""Imitate and identify""

I'm not aware of any other country in which this type of exercise is also popular. Even if the exercise in itself is quite enjoyable when one stumbles upon a subject he finds interesting, I always thought that it's quite a ludicrous exercise. Why is the meaning of a word or a group of word supposed to be linked with all the other meanings of this same word (especially when there is no clear context of enunciation) ? Why is each word possibly an interesting object of philosophical examination (potentially) ? Is the three parts argumentation an historical legacy of some kind ?  
The third part is also the most obscure thing in the french ""essay's methodology"" : it is supposed to be a kind of Aufhebung even though we are almost always forbidden to use a dialectical plan (in the sense that the essay should contain no logical contradiction that isn't resolved).  
Do you think that thinking about contradictions and tensions about words and groups of words (and trying to be exhaustive in rigorously processing their **common** meanings) ultimately tends to say something about reality ? Finally, assuming that languages are social products, how can this exercise still have meaning when it's about, for example, locutions that candidates are supposed to know but doesn't know (it might be a slightly outdated expression for example).

That's a lot of questions and I'm not sure I'm clear. Please tell me if you want me to be more precise and clear.

For instance, a theory with higher predictive power tends to have fewer assumptions and results in fewer surprises, while an elegant theory is often one that explains more with fewer variables. Similarly, theories that unify multiple phenomena tend to reduce the number of separate frameworks we need, thereby reducing overall complexity.

Given this pattern, it seems that most of the reasons we favor certain theories over others, such as their ability to explain and predict effectively, their simplicity, and their broader applicability, all align with the idea of minimizing unexplained complexity.

Is there any aspect of theory selection or evaluation that doesn't, in the end, reduce to minimizing unexplained complexity?

>For example, the kind 'human being' marks out each member as a distinct individual, allowing for identification, distinction, and counting (e.g., ""one human being, two human beings..."")

1m0w2oj,"If existentialism grants radical freedom, does it also demand communal responsibility?","Existentialist philosophy begins with a hard truth: there is no divine authority, no intrinsic moral order. there is only the absurdity of existence and the radical freedom of the individual. We are each solely responsible for our choices, our values, and the lives we construct. That freedom can be liberating, and overwhelming.

Many take this premise and conclude that meaning is impossible, or morality arbitrary. A fast path to nihilism. But what if that isn’t the necessary destination?

If I am truly responsible for myself, then I need certain conditions in order to exercise that responsibility meaningfully. I need access to resources. Not just for survival, but for self-actualization. A degree of material security gives me the capacity to make choices aligned with my values rather than choices dictated by desperation. (Maslow 101)

But here's the problem: many of the conditions that enable that kind of freedom are beyond my personal control. I didn’t choose where I was born, what family I came from, what laws govern my body, what illnesses I might face. If my flourishing depends on circumstances I cannot guarantee for myself, then isn’t the most practical strategy invest in a society that raises the baseline for everyone? 

By helping ensure others have their basic needs met, I help construct a world where I too can rely on that safety net in times of crisis. If my house burns down or I get a cancer diagnosis, I shouldn’t have to fall all the way to the bottom just to start over. Freedom is fragile unless it’s mutually reinforced.

So here's the argument I’m exploring:  
In accepting existentialism’s radical freedom, I am fully responsible for my moral self. But no person is an island, humans are social creatures and we all exist interdependent on one another in ways we can see and many that are hidden. Thus, I must also accept that my freedom is shaped by my interdependence. In that light, don’t I have a duty to help build the kind of community where everyone can afford to be free, and thus ensuring my own freedom?

should i just start with platos dialogues and branch out from there? as far as i am aware, that's where western philosophy builds itself, though please correct me if im wrong. i would certainly appreciate more specific recommendations, though. im not afraid of reading guides on primary sources, and would actually prefer those, but id like the content to be approachable from the perspective of someone who has more understanding that a layman (since i also do literature analysis, which naturally intersects with philosophy) but less than is intended for most sources, if that makes any sense. currently my only other plan is to listen to the oxford lectures, so anything helps.

And Nietzsche, to be honest, is too anti-social. It seems like a philosophy far removed from good human relations.

1m0qlw4,Questioning the fallaciousness of Homunculus Fallacies,"Every resource I find says homunculus style argumentation is fallacious since it leads to an infinite regress of explanations reformulated in terms of the very phenomenon it was meant to explain and that therefore they are not actually explanatory. But isn't this only effective a charge against someone who believes infinite regresses are non-explanatory (perhaps because he thinks they are impossible, or, if possible, are of their nature non-explanatory)? But then to call the homunculus argument fallacious would be question begging. Clearly, contradictions are fallacious, and typically the burden is on the person who wants to argue for non-classical logics which would justify contradictions. But the assumption that infinite regresses are fallacious is not anywhere near as endoxic as the assumption that contradictions are bad.

For example, I have never seen someone call the argument for an infinite past fallacious on grounds of being a kind of temporally extended homunculus regress. People who believe in an infinite past series of temporal events assume that an infinite number of past temporal events can intelligibly explain present and future temporal events. If someone calls them out as fallacious due to making a homuncular argument, that would be obnoxiously question begging. You would need a specific argument against infinite regresses being explanatory, and not just dialectically assert it. But if this is the case, what on earth is the point of the homuncular fallacy \*as a fallacy?\*

Or take a substance dualist. If I were the sort of dualist that did want to make a homuncular argument, I could just rebuke my opponent by saying infinite regresses are explanatory, and so it would be turtles (or little men) all the way down.

Is calling the homunculus fallacy a fallacy a case like where ""Just World fallacy"" and ""naturalistic fallacy"" are called fallacies? Just World could be true. Naturalism could be true. Homuncular explanatory chains could be true. Is the usage of ""fallacy"" in each of these cases just pejorative?",1752606275.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities

It allows systems to reference or apply operations to themselves in a way that generates complexity, solves problems dynamically, and often reveals deeper structure.

Yet in philosophy, especially in discussions of epistemology, ethics, or metaphysics; it seems like recursion is either underutilized or treated as a byproduct rather than a method. Most philosophical methodology still relies on linear reasoning, deduction, or appeals to foundational axioms.

My question is: **why isn’t recursion more centrally adopted as a formal tool or methodology in philosophy?** Are there historical or conceptual reasons for this? Or are there branches of philosophy where recursion is seen as a primary mode of reasoning, but just less emphasized in mainstream discourse?

1m0he6j,is art really subjective??,"hi . i have a long debate with Myself in my head, that where is beauty in the world??

is beauty in our head, our eyes, or beauty in in objects??

is Mona Lisa Really Beautiful?? it is Really An Art Objectively?? Or We See Mona Lisa Beautiful??

i Have believed years ago that beauty is something objective and its always same , and art is objective too , Hitchcock’s Vertigo is Really Beautiful , And its Beautiful Objectively, Hemingway’s A Movable Feast is Beautiful Objectively and if Someone find this artistic “Beautiful” works ugly, its because that subject don’t have good artistic vision .

but now I come to believe that there is objective beauty or art, and everything which Is beautiful, is in my mind, not in real world, for example, the Flower, is not really beautiful or ugly, but I see it beautiful or ugly because some Subjective Standards and Conditions.

I strongly believe that art and beauty is subjective, but I still have so many questions about that. And now im debating myself that is this really true?? If there is no objectively beautiful art, so why there is so many awards. And if art is completely subjective so what is real value of artist??

Why we say John Ford is a good director if art is subjective?? I art is subjective, isn’t that mean there is no good or bad artists and there is just different perspectives??

So I want to tell you all ideas which I believe and I want you to try help me understand better

Note : Whenever in my text I use word art, its equal to beauty

 

Beauty Standards Are Created in Societies :

There is no real beauty outside of societies, I think that society and system of power and also ideologies create Beauty Standards, and call some people beautiful and some other people ugly. Some art beautiful and some art ugly. And even Social Changes Make Standards Different .

For example , if you go to north Europa , and then go to some tribes in central Africa, you see  there is different beauty standards. I 20^(th) Century , There was An American/European Standard that every girl or woman who look like marilyn monroe (Blond Hair, White Skin and …) is Beautiful , but is blond hair really beautiful?? For example, go to google and search “Qajar Women” , you can see that before internet and Free Trade and … , the beauty standards seem completely different in a country like iran , The Qajar Women which look so beautiful in that time now are seem like a Meme, but with Globalization The Beauty Standards in iran are different now, Qajar Women are no longer seem beautiful, now American/European Like Women Seems to be beautiful . and now with expanding individualism in whole world, you can see that beauty Standards are different from person to person (not only culture to culture anymore) . every boy like some “Type of Girls” and every girl like some “Types of boy”.

Now. You can see that definition of Beautiful are change so much in 20^(th) century and then now in 21th century , for example. Look at artistic works in Renaissance . Look at Rafael, Michael Angelo or Da vinco, you can see that “Beautiful Thing” in Renaissance era was completely different from what we see as Beautiful in 21th century. Symmetry , Arrangement and Order was so much important In renaissance arts. But in 20^(th) century , it was completely different, with uprising of great artists like Picasso and with artistic styles like cubisme, Expressionism and … , now symmetry and order is no longer important in art .you can see peak of this in Jackson Pollock works, which there is completely chaos in his works,and somehow its still beautiful in its own way. Why Beauty Standards changes so much?? Isn’t because all of this standards are subjective and they can be different in different regions, cultures and … ? we can see this difference in music and cinema too , the order which was in classical Music,in Beethoven or in bach there is no longer in jazz or heavy metal or aggressive rock . but they are still “beautiful” . and the arrangement and order in classic movie frams, like Hitchcock or ford movies they are no longer in post-ww2 italian movies or in French new wave cinema. Isn’t that because social changes can make beauty standards different??

If we raise a kid, from birth in a white room away from society , does he still thinks that blond girls are more beautiful??

I think not only social changes make beauty standards changes, I do believe that many Power Systems,ideologies and … create their own definition of “beautiful”

 

\-          There is also so many individual things that make different in beauty standards. One of them is of course Unconscious Part of our mind, I think we don’t see the world how Descartes think , Descartes thinks that there is subjects and objects in the world, and there is a obvious border and difference between them, I don’t think this is true, I thick when we look at a object, in this process the subject and object become one, every individual see an object somehow, we don’t see object how they are but we see a object with our desires, fears, unconscious items and defaults. So each one of us see a table differently, with different perspective which comes from out unconscious mind.

\-          I think our defaults in our mind and our unconscious have a huge part in how we see the world. That’s why for some reason some people don’t like metal music because they think its full of screams and loud noises but some people find it beautiful,and some people find classical masterpieces boring but another one find it beautiful , I think if we have correct perspective , everything can be beautiful (Even Yoko Ono Screams or Jackson Pollock chaos paintings,lol)

So yes, I believe that art and beauty is completely subjective, and we should don’t let ideologies or our mind defaults tell us what is really beautiful or what is not really beautiful .

but also there is some questions that i have:

 

1-      If art is really subjective , what is value of artists????

2-      If art is really subjective, what is real purpose and point of reviews and critics?????

3-      If art is really subjective, what is point of academy awards like Oscar, Grammy or … ????

4- am i right??? is art really is subjective or im thinking wrong??",1752585114.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities

1lzj7b2,(Why) Is Academic Philosophy bad at Science Communication?,"Hey everyone :)

I have the impression (that I'm happy to be disabused of!) that academic philosophy is doing a poor job at communicating what it's working on to the general public, especially in theoretical philosophy.

As far as I'm aware, the major regular content creators producing philosophy content are:

1. Alex O'Connor (Cosmic Skeptic)
2. Abigail Thorn (Philosophy Tube)

But neither O'Connor nor Thorn are professional philosophers. O'Connor has a BA in Theology & Philosophy and Thorn has an MA in Philosophy. Consequently, neither of them are producing content on cutting edge contemporary philosophy.

Now I do want to be clear, I like and value both of these people's work. This is not an attempt to gatekeep, and actually if professional philosophers aren't willing to step up and make engaging content, I'm *really* glad that people like O'Connor and Thorn are. Their content is enjoyable. It's well produced and well edited. It's typically of a good standard, philosophically. But what it's not doing is attempting to communicate current or near-current research in philosophy.

Now there are some professional philosophers doing a decent job at trying to communicate:

1. Nigel Warburton's *Philosophy Bites*
2. Peter Adamson's *History of Philosophy without any Gaps*

But to my eye, these are more designed for an old media landscape; the podcast era of the early 2000s.  
I don't know their exact viewing figures, but I'd be surprised if they get anything close to O'Connor's or Thorn's engagement.  
Again, this is not to be critical of these people or their work. I really like both of these podcasts, but I don't think it would be too controversial to say that their goal is not to optimize for the modern media & communication landscape (nor necessarily should it).

So to finally get to the questions I'd love wider community input on:

1. Is Academic Philosophy bad at Science Communication?
2. If so, why is it?
3. Is this something that could or should change, and if so how?",1752490167.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities

I wanted to ask about the nature of conciousness. 

It seems to me that conciousness cannot-not be fundamental in the universe

That an experience is as necessary to the “‘is-ness” of existence as space and time is. 

To me it doesn’t make sense that time and space could exsist without concious experience. And the concious awareness (not necessarily restricted to the human experience, it could also be more that conciousness is a constant throughout the fabric of what is) must preceed time and space, or at least come about at conception, if that’s how it happened. Either way there has to be a witness for reality to exist.

the fact that there is something, must only imply that the concept of nothing is impossible, there cannot not be, because there is. and that same rule must apply to space and time, since there is an experience of space and time, there cannot not be an experience of space and time, and that experience must come about on the axis that time and space meet. 

There cannot be space without time, and there cannot be either without the experience of either.

1lzi1xt,What does Fredric Jameson mean here when describing the future with respect to Satre's ethics,"The quote below is from ""The years of theory: Postwar French though to the present"":

>We are talking about freedom as an ontological thing. What is my relationship to my being or to my existence? Can I be? If I can't be, how am I related to my not-being? What does it mean to not be something? Those are all ontological questions, and they eventually result in this business of the justification for my existence Which Michele Le Doeuff thought was not an interesting problem. The ontic version of freedom-am I free to cross the road? Am I free to rob the bank? Am I free to drive my car on the left hand side of the road?—is a very different matter, and, clearly, in politics there is going to be a slippage there. Sartre tried to make an ethics out of his ontological notion of freedom. **And you can see that existentialism does not dictate a notion of the future, and therefore cannot offer you any kind of advice about the content of your future actions.** Finally, Sartre gave up his project of writing an ethics. I think we here touch the limits of the Sartrean problematic, so to speak. **For existentialism, there is a kind of limitation which is the present**, which is my own individuality, and that is my own present of time. My future, as they like to say, is open.

I think I may have missed something leading up to this. I'm not sure I'm clear on the ontics/ontological distinction for freedom, and I don't really see how the separation between types of being with respect to freedom can be used to define an ethics?

Further, why is this ethics valid in the present, but not in the future?",1752485883.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities
1lzi0vy,Why isn't growing-block time the most logical interpretation?,"Hello! I've been thinking about physics and the world as part of a minor existential crisis recently (expect some misunderstanding as I've largely done so through the lens of science communication and pop science rather than textbooks) and I came across the two (or three) interpretations of time: presentism, eternalism, and no-futurism (growing block).

I've seen that presentism seems to have issues with relativity (as in, which frame of reference can be considered the most ""real""), and eternalism seeming to be entirely unintuitive to the way things seem to be (even if it's the most widely held view in PhilSci). While I hate to say compromise is the best solution, doesn't growing block account best for these things? Let's imagine someone who can see me from a light year away (and let's assume they have line of sight and perfect vision and what have you). Then they could see myself as I was a year ago whatever I was doing then. If we can say both of these are equally real (and as side question - why is that? Why is the frame of reference at 0 from the observed not considered the most real with respect to it?) but no one can see my future (as far as I can tell) then why not growing block?

I'm aware a part of my confusion comes from considering myself and some observer, rather than a third object to which I and another observer can perceive.

1lzcoyf,"Derrida's ""game"" and other doubts about ""Plato's Pharmacy""","(I'm from Brazil and I am reading Derrida in portuguese. I hope I am translating the terms correctly).

I just started reading Jacques Derrida's ""Plato's Pharmacy"" for college and I have a few questions. If anyone could help me, I would be really thankful.
In the very first pages, he uses the term ""the text's game"" very often. My first question would be what he means by ""the text's game"", but I believe the answer might only be possible if it is first explained what ""text"" means to Derrida. This is the first time ever I'm reading anything by Derrida, so I just suppose (by the way he uses these terms so freely and without much explanation) that he has talked about such topics in other books or articles. I also suppose that ""text"" has a special meaning to Derrida because of the famous ""there is nothing outside the text"" (or something like this) quote.

So far, I've just read the first chapter (or ""section"" or ""part"") of the book. It sure was a bit strange but I got through it (altough I think I will reread it while taking notes). I have also watched a few videos about the book and read the Wikipedia articule about ""pharmakon"". I think I got the general idea of it: traditionally, people interpreted Plato as if he believed that writing was bad due to Socrates's argument on ""Phaedrus"" that involves an egyptian myth; philosophers have traditionally believed, because of this interpretation, that writing is inferior to oral dialogue in the pursuit of truth through philosophy, in a way that writing is only a ""supplement"" (this word is used a lot, I wonder if it has a special meaning in this context or if the dictionary definition works just fine) to speech; Derrida argues that Plato actually does not merely oppose to writing, and that this interpretation is mistranslating ""pharmakon"" in a way that singularizes the meaning of the term, while both meanings (""cure"", ""poison"") should be considered; yadayadayada (I problably butchered this explanation but I swear I can do it better in portuguese lol).

I would like to finish this reading by this friday. The book (wich is actually more of an essay) has nine sections, and I think it is possible to do if I read 2 sections per day. For those of you who have read it: are the next sections more difficult than the first one?

Moreover, any helpful articles (or videos or whatever) about ""Plato's Pharmacy"" and its themes are welcome.

I came to the conclusion that it was merely due to which way you defined meaning: either an intrinsic truth or a subjective purpose. If meaning is purely supposed to be an objective fact given from the universe, then nihilism is correct since there is no intrinsic meaning (unless you believe in God) and therefore existentialism is more of a cope. Yet if meaning is purpose or defined in a more abstract way, then existentialism would work due to the belief in a subjective meaning built through one’s existence and nihilism is just a lack of creating that meaning.

1lzexoz,"SCT, Reductionism, and Moral Reasons","I’m reading the SEoP entry on Social Contract Theory, and I was wondering if someone could help me understand non-moral reasons as they relate to the justificatory problem for contractarian theories of the SC.

As I understand it, contractarians defend a reductionist approach in justifying moral authoritarianism, and two strengths of this approach are 1) the ontology of non-moral reasons are far easier to prove, avoiding having to solve the foundational crisis of morality, and 2) non-moral reasons are available to all rational agents, the parties being modelled, at all times, so the contract will still be able to function even when moral disagreements ensue.

In reply to 1), I don’t understand how this avoids the foundational problem of morality.  Parties are still able to have moral reasons prior to the contract, they just might not all be responsive to the same ones, ergo appealing to non-moral reasons is more useful and justifies moral authority better.  In this same vein, I don’t understand why prudence for one’s own safety and interests can’t be construed as a moral reason.  An agent might take their happiness to be more important due to proximity, and isn’t caring for oneself at the expense of others a form of morality, anyway?  If it isn’t, what about limiting consideration to one’s family in the state of nature—isn’t that moral, because it is no longer self-interested?

In response to 2), how can any social contract formed from non-moral reasons be considered moral, when the whole object of the contract is stability and security for oneself?  That doesn’t appear to move away from prudence to a moral consideration of others, as you would just be using people as a mere means for fulfilling your own desire for safety.",1752473614.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities

Is that a problem for someone who considers themselves philosophically inclined? Does it preclude philosophical coherence?","So, one of my good friends is an Anglican priest. I'm a materialist atheist, I'd say. I only believe in one physical reality and that ultimately everything that exists can ultimately be empirically understood. During our conversations on morality he tries to get me to identify a specific basis for my moral beliefs. I still hold a lot of ""slave morality"" positions, I believe in the golden rule for example. I tell him that it's just an instinctual imperative, that human relationships are complex webs of reciprocal altruism and what we call morality is just a post-hoc system for describing these unconscious instinctual drives and their expected outcomes. He doesn't find this satisfactory. He doesn't think that if I believe it's purely animal instinct that I wouldn't just abandon moral  principles at my convenience or when I thought it would benefit me. He doesn't believe me to the point where if he didn't already know me, he would have a hard time trusting me if I were another person with my same moral justification. Another example is he doesn't understand why I'd have Marxist politics if I don't believe in the divinely-granted goodness or dignity of people and just think of humans (myself included) as animals (non-derogatory.)

I am a very mid philosophy enjoyer, so while I like philosophy and learning about it quite a bit, I haven't done a ton of actual reading.

1lytryd,Is evil the default for human beings?,"Sorry if it's a bit long.

1)In the Plato's Republic, Glaucon talks about the ring of Gyges, a magical ring that can make you invisible. He argues that if anyone would wear it, they'd steal food, property, ""bed"" anyone they want etc... And most rational people would actually think you'd be stupid if you didn't take advantage of such powers (god-like powers). 

Glaucon was backing Thrasymachus' argument that ""pleonexia"" (extreme greed) is the natural state of human beings and that the ""highest pleasure"" in life is to commit injustice without being caught (and the worst in life was to endure injustice without justice afterwards). I found Socrates' counter-arguments rather weak.

What would you do if you were invisible? For strange reasons, most people wouldn't think of doing ""good"" or virtuous things if they were invisible (try to ask people around you). Doing virtuous things seems to matter if we can be seen and rewarded socially for it.

If evil was our default, it would explain why morality, benevolent gods and saints are so revered in human history, because it is so rare in normal circumstances.

It would explain the cynical behavior of politicians since the dawn of time and also explain why modern capitalism has been so successful (see the Fable of Bees by Mandeville)?

2) But I also remember an episode of the Twilight Zone ""A Nice Place to Visit"". A criminal dies and then his guardian angel appears and says he can have anything he wants. Anything he wants appear out of nowhere (money, women etc.). After a period, he becomes bored and hates it. He asks his guardian angel to send him to Hell and says that he doesn't belong to Heaven. His guardian angel replies: Heaven? What made you think this was Heaven? This ""is"" Hell.

So we can ask ourselves if this ring of Gyges would only make people do bad things temporarily. As soon as their carnal desires dissipates because of habituation in an ""eternal time-frame"", they would start do virtuous and angelic things secretly to help people out of pure boredom. And it would probably give them more satisfaction and pleasure on the long run. They could also observe the ripple effect of a single ""good"" action over very long periods of time (bad actions too).

So my point of view to this question would be ""yes"" human being are evil by default. But it is caused by the limitation of the human body. The same energy given enough time would be ""good"" actually. So in my theory evil and good are the same energy. Evil is the child form and Good is the adult form of this energy. Evil is that energy not used to Eternity, and Good is that energy used to Eternity. Evil people are learning Eternity, Good people remember Eternity better. 

3) In this view, there is no Evil and Good. There is something beyond both. And every soul is learning Eternity. Because Eternity never finishes by definition, humility is important. Nobody is completely a teacher or ever graduates. Everybody is a student. Everybody is a teacher. Compassion and humility become essential virtues for the good life. Contemplation on ""Timeless"" truths can help you remember your true nature, as a lot of philosophers said in history.


That was my explanation to the ""people are naturally evil"" argument. What do you think about Glaucon and Thrasymachus' arguments? About mine? After all these food for thoughts, the main and only question remains : Is evil the default for human beings? 

PS : Evil here is defined as pleonexia and desire to experience injustice ""without getting caught"".

In other words, to every description, there is a corresponding object that satisfies the description and has ‘being’. 

So coming to the meta-ethics in this case, irrespective of whether one is a moral realist or anti-realist there is an issue with there “being” opposing and contradictory moral facts (albeit non-existent). So my central concern is this: what reason is there to deny normative force to non-existing moral facts that have being?

But it is precisely the later Wittgenstein's idea that meaning arises from social use (language games, forms of life) that closely resembles the concept of spontaneous order:
Both view rules and order not as the result of rational design, but as emergent from evolved practices. Both also share a skepticism toward excessive rationalism and centralized planning. (And yes, I know that the similarity is rather small)

1lyrxmt,The trolley problem (again),"The trolley problem/TP, it's fair to say, has been very widely discussed in philosophy, psychology, and so-called experimental psychology. From my own, admittedly quite limited, reading on the topic, it seems to be usually or often discussed in light of the opposition between utilitarianism and deontology. However, for me, the TP isn't a genuine problem at all, and hence it tells us little about ethics in general or about this supposed deontology-versus-utilitarianism debate in particular. The TL:DR here is that none of the 'people' in the hypothetical TP have any substantial resemblance to any real human beings. I'm wondering, then, what are the flaws (and strengths, if any) of my argument.

Suppose I'm a participant in a TP study. The researcher asks me to make the choice of who is going to die: one person, or the other five people together. I choose the five people to die, and the researcher asks me why. ""Well,"" I respond, ""that one person is my brother, whereas the other five people are all evil psychopaths and deserve to die."" The researcher might laugh uncomfortably and point out that I'm mistaken. So I ask: ""Okay, tell me more about all these [six] people. Where are they from? What kind of people are they? How old are they? What do they look like?"", and so on. 

And, in the face of such questions,  I imagine that the researcher couldn't and wouldn't give any concrete answers. This wouldn't be because they themselves lack the relevant information; the researcher isn't going to say to me, ""Give me fifteen minutes while I search for the answers,"" no. Rather, all this information is *inherently and necessarily* absent from the hypothetical ""humans"" in the TP.

So the TP set-up seems to involve hypothetical humans *who lack pretty much every substantial feature that makes a person human*: identity, personality, appearance, kinship relations, right down to more mundane stuff (in relative terms) like height, weight, hair colour, etc. And all these are the sorts of things which, in real life, make a massive difference in TP-like moral dilemmas. We could, in theory at least, replace them  - the six ""people"" in the TP scenario - with Lego figurines (say), and little would be lost.

Where philosophy and Moral Relativism emerge from Moral Naturalism the same way Chemistry emerges from Physics and Biology from Chemistry.

Something tells me if you asked a Moral Naturalist like Sam Harris to ""go up a level"" he would say that within the scope of philosophy, there is mo way to bridge the IS-OUGHT gap because it's a limitation of the framework.

1lxw0ek,Reading on physics and idealism,"Hi, I'm looking for some reading material to follow up some thoughts I've had. I'm a physicist by training but have been reading philosophy on and off for most of my life. I always seem to end up back at the hard problem of consciousness.

I used to dismiss idealism as being absurd, but somehow I've landed on it recently and can't seem to shake it off.

First of all I think the hard problem is a real problem for physicalism. I read Consciousness Explained, and thought it should have been titled 'Everything Except Consciousness Explained'. For a while I tried to be all Wittgensteinian and convince myself that the problem is just a mismatch of language and context, but that was equally unsatisfying as Dennett.

Here are my premises:

1. There is a phenomenal consciousness ('my' phenomenal consciousness although I'm not presupposing a coherent self or ego),
2. There are other instances of phenomenal consciousness (i.e. other minds),
3. The laws of physics are objectively true (or at least, approximating an objective truth).

Note that I'm using 'objective' in the sense of being agreed on by all rational minds; I'm not presupposing any physical world that is independent of minds.

From this I've convinced myself, for now, of the following:

1. Minds (or instances of phenomenal consciousness) are fundamentally what there is,
2. The various phenomena (appearing in those minds) are correlated with each other (both within a single mind and between minds) in an ordered way,
3. The laws of physics describe or approximate those correlations.

As an illustration, starting from an everyday language–description, two people watch an apple fall from a tree. They both experience this in their phenomenal consciousness. They talk about it afterwards and agree that the apple did fall, and that it fell with a certain acceleration towards the ground; they even agree that the apple was a certain colour. Their phenomenal experiences are correlated in such a way, and also correlated with all the other things that they have previously experienced, such that they can come to this agreement. To each person, the vocalisation of his/her observation (and the hearing of the other person’s observation) are just more phenomena, but these speaking and hearing phenomena are also correlated with the other person's such that they both have the experience of talking to each other about the apple falling. The nature of the correlations are such that they can be described or approximated by the laws of physics, but physics is just describing correlations between mental phenomena: the objects of physics like electrons and photons aren't independently real.

If that makes any sense, I would like to identify this or related positions within serious philosophy and do some reading. Is this analytical idealism? Or is it just subjective idealism with God replaced by physical laws? I haven't read either Kastrup’s book or Berkeley. I'm willing to, but hoping for some direction so I don't end up wasting months of reading time like I did with Dennett (sorry Dennett fans!).

As a physicist I'm also deeply interested in how this viewpoint relates to the possibility that space and time are emergent—that a theory of everything might not explicitly include space and time, and simply describe correlations betweeen quantum states. Unforunately I'm not good enough of a physicist to be working on that seriously.",1752311120.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities
1lxu8lw,i'm a moral error theorist. how do i function in polite society?,"hi. i know the title may seem venty or overly emotive, i am not good at wording things. for background i had only very little philosophy education in my one and only semester of uni before i burnt out due to disability

i'm a moral error theorist. i am bad at articulating my position, but it's best to describe it as a position of last resort: accepting the existence of objective moral facts creates some very strange logical implications i don't like, and there is no evidence for the existence of these objective moral facts. so i don't think they exist. even though i may have knee-jerk responses that seem to appeal to morality on further contemplation they usually tend to be out of self-interest (ultimately translating to ""that disgusts me"" or ""i don't like it"") and i want to try and stop thinking that way

but, simply, how the hell do you apply this in real life without sounding like a monster? there are plenty of injustices in the world and most people aren't error theorists and tend to moralise. if, for example. my friend found out she got cheated on, and she asks me for advice if she could ever forgive her partner, what do i say? ""actually, i don't believe your partner did anything wrong by cheating on you because i think all moral truths are categorically wrong""? she'd never speak to me again.

you might say ""it's a social situation, put down the philosophy and comfort your friend in this fictional scenario"" - but i think *that is the problem*. it seems like the only way i can function in social life is by lying about my beliefs and making judgements that i don't believe in so i can fit in. if i do speak up for what i believe in, i'd come off as a psychopath. this is not enough to make me abandon moral error theory - again, i think believing in objective moral truths creates implications i can't stomach - but is there a way out of this social dilemma?",1752304080.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities
1ly6epd,Can something that contains time also change within time,"ve been exploring a metaphysical question that arises from general relativity:

Spacetime is described as a 4D structure — it includes time as one of its dimensions. Therefore, it doesn’t “experience” time from within. It simply *is*, as a fixed 4D object: the so-called ""block universe.""

But we also say that spacetime **curves** in response to mass, **ripples** with gravitational waves, or **expands** with the universe. These sound like **changes** — yet change seems to require a passage of time.

So here's my central question:

>

Could this suggest spacetime is embedded in some **meta-structure** that allows for evolution or interaction — possibly a kind of meta-time?

Follow-up questions:

* Is there a coherent metaphysical view that allows **change without time**?
* Does spacetime truly evolve — or is it only our perception moving through a fixed structure?
* And finally:**Can time itself be said to ""experience"" time? Or is that a category mistake?**

1lxuasm,How can truth exist if everything is constantly in motion?,"I feel like the need for absolute truth is some sort of hyper-development of learning behaviour.  
Like, for example a rat trained to pull a lever is likely quite convinced that there's a causal connection between pulling the lever and getting the food, which is good and nice and promotes the animal's survival.  
Now make that rat super-intelligent and self-aware and he'll eventually realize that the lever gives the food but not always (perhaps there's no more food or perhaps all scientists in the lab were hit by lightning).  
Since learning is static, he'll have to admit that lever -> food is ""Not always true"", and is affected by other factors in a larger system, and look for other truths to make the act of getting food more consistent and reliable. And if given enough time, I believe this super-intelligent rat will develop a language, start making axioms and become depressed.

And I mean, how can truth exist if learning is based on encoding static patterns while everything is in a constant state of change but not always? Even apparently true statements such as A = A depend on A being compared to itself in an imagined immobile state of being.  
I can see that ""No truth can exist"" and ""Everything is in a constant state of change"" contradict themselves, but I have to express myself in an understandable way as a large sentient rat for other large sentient rats.

tldr: the static nature of animal learning, which we base our logic on, doesn't allow us to find absolute truth in a world that is in constant motion but not always

But at the same time, when I questioned why atheists couldn’t use, for example, suffering (as utilitarians do) as a moral axiom, I would hear the objection that this axiom isn’t logically justifiable. The more I studied why this is the case and the more I read, the first name I would find was Hume. And the more I read about his arguments, the more I found myself agreeing with what he says. Not only that I think it’s possible to expand his arguments further. The naturalistic fallacy is the argument that says just because things are a certain way, that means they ought to be that way. If the naturalistic fallacy applies to utilitarian ethics (which it certainly does), why couldn’t it be applied to divine morality? Why do we accept the idea that just because God says something, we ought to obey Him? Now, as a Muslim, I’m not saying that I’m not obligated to obey God. I’m simply saying I’m not logically obligated to do that. You still need a separate moral assumption that tells you to submit to divine will, and that’s not derived from God’s nature or commands it’s imported from outside. I’ve heard a couple of objections, like the idea that God’s nature is good, or the idea that logic doesn’t apply to God, but these arguments fall short easily. Because if we say that God’s nature is the good itself, that doesn’t explain why we ought to act in accordance with it unless we already value “the good.” Still a value bridge.

If a slave was forced to do a task but they can do the task however they please, most would say they dont have free will simply for the reason they didnt have a choice to be a slave. So does the fact that they lacked free will in becoming a slave make all there other options void of free will?

If we didnt have to choice to be born or not, does that contradict free will as we are limited in choices?

Surely the only way to have free will is to be an omnipotent necessary being. But they cant consent to exist as theyve always existed.

Then there is no possible way for free will to exist for any entity

1lx6e8h,How do Christians respond to these contradictions on the ontological argument proving God's existence?,"Hello, I'd like to inform you that I don't speak English, so I'm sorry if things get lost in translation.

  
So, here's the modern ontological argument : 

modal logic Based on AXIOME S5

If it is possible that it is necessary for X to exist, then X necessarily exists.

If X does not necessarily exist, then it is impossible for it to be necessary for X to exist. 

Example: If your laptop doesn't necessarily exist, then it's impossible for it to be necessary for your laptop to exist. 

1. Being necessary is not contingent. This means that either A, it is impossible for it to exist, or B, it necessarily exists. 

2. If it is possible for necessary being to exist, then it is not impossible for it to exist.

3. And if it's not impossible for it to exist, then it necessarily exists (by negating A, we're left with B).

4. So if it is possible for necessary being to exist, then it necessarily exists. (N°1 + N°2 + N°3)

But how do Christians respond to the 2 arguments that “just because we define a perfect thing doesn't mean it must exist” and “if it's possible for a necessarily non-existent being to exist, then it doesn't exist in any world” and why is axiom S5 reliable?

I'm supposed to give a presentation on it this week and one of the requirements is relating the work to one of the theories in the title, but I can't say I'm finding it as easy as I thought it would be.

Upon first thought, the obvious thought would be Cartesian dualism, AM directly quoting ""Cogito ergo sum, I think therefore I am, I AM'', and the hint at him developing consciousness in this line ""But one day AM woke up and knew who he was"". Furthermore, in the end, the main character Ted, becomes a being that does not physically resemble human beings and is not capable of many physical actions because he lacks his limbs and his mouth, that is his physical state. The last line in the story is the title itself. Ted has the desire to scream because of the horror and misery he is enduring; that is his mental state.

 But I am finding it difficult to fully align AM with Cartesian dualism, we know he is conscious and aware, but does cartesian dualism justify that in robots? AM has no body and no brain, he is a machine. The course's name itself is Minds and Machines so this is crucial for me to explain. Can his consciousness and his hate be considered a mental state, and can his programming and the machine that functions as his body be considered his physical state? My friend thinks that functionalism would be easier to justify because it accepts that AM can be conscious without being biological, Ted can still suffer without a body (because mental states are functions, not matter),and supports the idea that minds can be replicated or emerge from machine, but I'm still on the fence",1752305344.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities

1lxc0tx,Why do other humans get to decide laws and systems of justice for other humans?,"


I'm not sure if this belongs here, but I had a thought recently and the conclusion basically was. Humans made laws for humans to protect humans against humans.

Of course I know that there are...things we consider ethical and some from religious scriptures and texts and all that.

But at what point in life did we get to the point where other humans get to make choices on how other similar humans live?

And at what point did that become so common?
Ruling and being ruled have existed for since the begging of life however way one believed it started...

But why? Why must we live according to how another human lives and yet we claim to be free?

I don't think freedom lies in doing what you want, or what makes you happy. It has never been that way.
I think 'freedom' is living how other humans live so you can make other people live with you as well.

If true freedom really existed then everyone should be in jail now. 
It is a wierd thought, disgusting, even to myself, but I believe those people society tables as monsters those who give in to the most depraved desires, example serial killers, are the ones closer to being free.

But my saving grace for that thought is that, they are also the farthest from freedom, because they are chained down by their own desires, desires of which are not good or appreciated or ethical.

Which brought me back to a thought, how did other humans sit down and decide which desire was right to have and which wasn't.

Some are common sense, I certainly don't think we need a law against pedophiles, because at that point it's just something mentally or spiritually wrong with you. 

Buy say for a example a case like, revenge. In a situation where a child is killed. The father out of rage kills the killer of his child. 

In the first place religion and ethics says that the father should've forgiven the killer.

If they went to court, and the killer was sentenced to death, then it is fine at that point. No arguments on ethics or religion or anything.

The outcome is the same either way. The killer is dead and his blood is on the hands of another.
I think my thoughts are going in a circle here.

But my point is, I don't like how 'laws' and 'system of justice' are implemented and made and decided.
This whole idea of other humans sitting down to make laws for other humans is weird ro me.

Pathetically enough, I will still follow the rules. And I can't say I won't follow them because there are some rules taught and normalised for me since I was a child.

1lwsmst,Martin Heidegger’s The Origin of the Work of Art,"I’m currently reading The Origin of the Work of Art by Heidegger and I have an issue that is making me feel as if I am missing something key. 

In the work, Heidegger is adamant that a world of art holds “truth” in it and that we shouldn’t simply view art for its thingy qualities but also its phenomenalogical aspects; it’s earthly qualities as well as its worldly qualities. 

I love all of this regarding his way of viewing art as I am a fan of reading about phenomenology, but I’m very skeptical of his way of thinking we aren’t just making individual interpretations of art but actually seeing truth through it. For instance he speaks so much about van Gogh’s painting of shoes and goes on this poetic journey of describing them as more than just shoes in a painting but as peasant shoes belonging to a woman and the world of these shoes, etc. which I would be fine with if he wasn’t making these statements as if they are showing a “world of truth.” When looking at the painting I kept asking myself “but are those peasant shoes? Are they even a woman’s shoes?” And so I looked up the history of the painting and it seems he was wrong. These shoes likely were van Gogh’s and were likely worn out in mud on purpose to get the desired look. 

Now i get that Heidegger was from rural Germany and so his phenomenological experience of them makes sense but I struggle so much to understand how he is implying this is more than just his personal interpretation and that he somehow is supposed to have some form of historical knowledge which seems he was proven wrong. 

Am I missing something here or is this a case of Heidegger making major assumptions and assuming he’s right? ",1752192851.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities

I understand that you can never definitively prove memory is reliable due to the fact that if you were to try and prove its legitimacy you'd have to rely on memory to remember a time you remembered correctly (circular argument). One of the true ways of ever knowing something definitively is through sense experience (I can feel my hands typing on this keyboard, I can feel the carpet brushing against my feet, etc.) Would that mean that (past) memory is only unreliable due to it being a synthetic imitation of sense experience? I can't physically be there to prove weather or not something did or did not happen because I am permanently stuck in the present, so wouldn't that make all my past experiences recreations of what supposedly happened or heard happened? And if those memories are synthetic, fake, wouldn't that definitively classify that as unreliable since it had to be falsely created through supposed history to have even been concepted?

1lwsaig,Does the Mary's Room Knowledge Argument still make sense in light of visual prosthesis devices?,"From what I understand of the Mary's Room thought experiment, the scenario goes like this:  

-Mary is a scientist who has gained ""all physical information"" of the color red, despite having always existed in a black and white room.  
-One day she leaves that room and sees a red object, say a ripe tomato.  
-Mary's subjective first person experience of seeing red lies outside ""all physical information"" about red.  
-Therefore physicalism is false, since subjective first person knowledge of what a red tomato looks like is not physical information.  

For around four decades now, we've had medical implants that could allow blind people to perceive lights and shapes in a limited manner. Digital cameras and rangefinders gather data, and that data is translated into electrical impulses that stimulate the optic nerves, which in turn produce a semblance of a person's surroundings from a first person perspective.  

We're not quite there yet with producing color sensations, but a study in 2020 already stated patients given a medical implant that bypasses the photoreceptors to directly stimulate the retinal neurons reported seeing yellow/blue, depending on the frequency of electro-stimulation. Given this, it seems only a matter of time before we can build a device that can induce the sensation of ""seeing red"" without there having to be a red object. This physical device, operating on physical areas of Mary's body, under well understood principles of physics and biology, would activate a capacity that Mary's body has always possessed, despite there being nothing in her room emitting photons in the 625–750 nanometer range that we would perceive as red. So, having used this device as part of her study on red, and armed with this knowledge, would Mary then learn anything new about red upon leaving her room and seeing a red tomato for the first time?  

So, to me, it seems like the conclusion would be either, no, Mary does not learn anything new, and the Mary's Room scenario does not disprove physicalism. Or, more bizarrely, the existence of such a physical device, operating on well understood physical principles, that lets Mary see red without there being anything red in her room, somehow nonetheless disproves physicalism by producing special knowledge that lies outside of ""all physical information.""

1lw5ios,The Origin of First-Person Subjectivity: Why Do I Feel Like “Me”?,"
How does the brain generate the sense of subjectivity—the lived, first-person perspective that underlies the unmistakable feeling of being a single, unified self, situated somewhere in space, and interacting meaningfully with the environment? I’m not asking about personality traits or behavioral identity, but about the core, raw experience of “being someone” from within.

There exists a compelling tension between how we experience subjectivity and how we understand the brain scientifically. While cognitive neuroscience studies the brain as a physical organ—complex networks of neurons firing unconsciously—our immediate experience treats subjectivity as a vivid, unified, conscious presence. Although one might say the brain and the self are aspects of the same system described at different levels, this does not explain why Subjectivity feels the way it feels.

The central dilemma is paradoxical by design:

>There is no one who has experiences—only the experience of being someone.

This is not wordplay. We know, The human brain constructs a phenomenal self-model (PSM)—a dynamic, high-resolution simulation of a subject embedded in a world. Crucially, this model is transparent: it does not represent itself as a model. Instead, it is lived-through as reality. The “I” is not something that exists and then gets modeled; it is the very content of the model.

We know then, From this, arises the illusion of a subject. But the illusion is not like a stage trick seen from the outside. It is a hallucination without a hallucinator, a feedback system in which the representational content includes the illusion of a point of origin. The brain simulates an experiencer, and that simulation becomes the center of gravity for memory, agency, and attention.

Perhaps the most disorienting implication about subjectivity is this:

>The certainty of being a subject is itself a feature of the model.

From the perspective of current cognitive science, which mechanisms or models—such as higher-order representations, attention schemas, or integrated information—might bridge this gap and explain how the brain produces this persistent, centered “I-ness”?

I’m doing research on autonomous weapons systems and its ethical considerations. In one of the papers by Peter Lee a quote of “Take out the human and you also take out the humanity if the decision to kill” made me stop and start thinking about killing and death.
Is killing a person an ethical and humane thing to do? 
If we knows in the context of war that that 
person will kill others will us killing them be a “good” (or best) thing to do?  In theory it will 
save the suffering of others, but the toll will be paid by you even if you sit in a cotrol room 2000km away.

1lwj58u,"Assuming God is the foundation of objective morality, can He override moral obligations through a command to perform an otherwise immoral action without contradicting His own nature, if moral obligations are themselves grounded in that nature?","I'm unsure if this question fits here as it is a theologically-loaded question.

In an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjsSHd23e0Q&list=WL&index=45) with Alex O'Connor on the topic of the slaughter of Canaanites, William Lane Craig defends the view that God can command actions that would otherwise be immoral when divine command is not present. He argues as follows (summarised rather than quoted directly):

God is the foundation of objective morality. Moral values and duties are grounded in His nature. At the same time, He is not constrained by moral obligations in the same way humans are. He can command actions that would otherwise be considered immoral, provided these commands are consistent with His loving and just nature. 

But If God’s nature is the standard by which actions are judged to be objectively good or evil meaning that immoral actions are those that go against God’s character then how can it ever be possible for God to command something that, under ""normal"" circumstances, would be considered evil, and still have it be consistent with His nature?

Put differently: If an action is objectively immoral because it contradicts God’s nature or will, how can it ever be consistent with God's nature? How can God command such an action without violating His own moral nature? Wouldn’t this imply that God’s nature can accommodate actions that are, by definition, inconsistent with it?",1752169544.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities
1lvx0w9,Are there any apriori arguments for continued existence?,"Suppose that an object exists in a state s. After some time, it remains in state s. Let’s call this scenario A.

Suppose that after some time, it changes into a different state z. Let’s call this scenario B.

In both cases, one can imagine logical alternatives. We could imagine, in the first case, that the object changed from a state S to another state. In the second scenario, we could imagine the object to have stayed in state S, or changed to another state that is not Z.

So from a purely logical perspective, it seems as if both need explanation. However, there is a common intuition that if an object does not have any forces operating on it that would change it, or destroy it, the object would continue to exist. Some argue that the very notion of existence implies continued existence in the absence of changing forces.

So, does continued existence need explanation? And does it need more or less explanation than if the object changes or ceases to exist after existing?

1lw2gjj,Does Suffering Need an Audience to Matter?,"

I keep coming back to this question: Does our suffering have any meaning if no one sees it?

In a world where everything’s documented, shared, reacted to, it sometimes feels like pain that isn’t witnessed might as well not exist. But that thought leads me into strange territory. If something deeply personal, like suffering, goes unseen, unheard, unvalidated, does that take away its weight? Or does it become something else entirely?

I’m not someone with a background in philosophy. I work in tech, but I’ve always been curious about these questions. I’ve read bits of existentialism and nihilism here and there, enough to know that people like Camus or Sartre believed meaning isn't given to us; we’re the ones who have to create it. At the same time, nihilism kind of whispers the opposite: that maybe there’s no meaning at all, no matter what we do.

So where does that leave silent suffering?

Maybe it’s not about whether it matters to the world. Maybe it matters because you went through it. Because it changed you. And maybe that’s the only kind of meaning that actually holds up, something internal, unmeasured, invisible.

Sometimes I think the pain no one sees is the most honest kind. There’s no performance in it. No reward. Just you, and the weight of it, and the choice to keep going anyway.

And maybe that’s enough.

1lvrbsi,Where do Marx & Engels Assert Capitalism as a 'Necessary Precursor' for Socialism & Communism?,"*(I am an (left) Anarchist)*

Given the importance of dialectical/historical materialism to Marxism, I understand the technical necessity of capitalism to exist as a precursor to socialism and successively, communism. The former logic can be applied to feudalism's existence allowing for the emergence of capitalism. Official texts aside, it is fairly common sentiment (on internet forums) that Marx & Engels explicitly asserted the necessity of capitalism as a developmental stage that, given the proper conditions and time, would *inevitably* lead to socialism -- communism. This is asserted on the view that capitalism creates classes: Proletariat & Bourgeoise, with the conditions necessary for the Proletariat to overthrow the Bourgeoise created under capitalism. This is a *technicality* rather than a normative statement, in the same way the existence of marine animals is predicated on the existence of a 'marine', which is true due to the literal meaning of the words, rather than the existence of an 'ought'; I view the former as a semantic argument. 

I want to know if Marx & Engels ever actually 'officially' made these claims, or whether these were (understandably) second-hand extrapolations from analyses of dialectical/historical materialism. It is *technically* true that the Marxist view of history as a series of stages, essentially requires the existence of capitalism, if socialism is to emerge, but it doesn't necessarily mean Marx nor Engels made this assertion themselves. 

I am looking for excerpts of Marx & Engels 'praising' capitalism for specific benefits/creating the conditions necessary for socialism/communism i.e post-scarcity; ""*The free development of individualities, and hence not the reduction of necessary labour time so as to posit surplus labour, but rather the general reduction of the necessary labour of society to a minimum, which then corresponds to the artistic, scientific etc. development of the individuals in the time set free, and with the means created, for all of them.**^("")*

The above quote serves as another example of a second-hand extrapolation, rather than an explicit claim of post-scarcity (I understand Marx's non-use of the word does not necessarily imply it wasn't what he meant). 

I'd like to read from official writings, explanations given by Marx of Engel's of capitalism's benefits, that allow for the emergence of successive stages. My understanding is that our modern existence allows us to look back and realize that communism could never have been achieved during Marx & Engel's time considering the technological and (assuming) social conditions simply could not have been met, due to barriers of their time.

The last and best of them, Marcus Aurelius, chose his son, Commodus, to succeed him. Commodus was a cruel guy. He neglected his duties. He spent most of his time beating up disabled veterans in the Colosseum. He drained the imperial coffers. And he essentially allowed extreme government corruption.

Also, I gained an intuition (which I still can’t properly articulate) that the agent making the same choice all the time in Rollback argument doesn’t deal a fatal blow to libertarianism. 

To sum it all up, I became convinced that free will is primarily about sourcehood, and alternative possibilities might be completely irrelevant to libertarianism. 

However, Bergson is obviously not mentioned a lot in contemporary discussions of free will, and most incompatibilist sourcehood theorists seem to be theists who simply argue for sourcehood as a necessary condition for moral responsibility.

I am set to graduate in law in Continental Europe next year.

Is this why depression and anxiety are at their highest points currently because there’s no clear answer to this question? There is no clear goal that humans currently have beyond unhelpful answers such as the idea that we have to develop and grow as a species which tells us nothing but to want and desire more than we have. If the goal is to always expand then there can never be an end goal because the universe will always seem to get larger.

I am currently going through a terrible depression for about 4 months now. This has absolutely nothing to do with my point, but I feel like explaining where I’m at mentally shows where I may be coming from.

I am a Christian. I was raised Catholic and went to Catholic schools, but the religion was never pushed on me. I’ve had a few moments that have made me turn to religion, and for a while I really did not have doubts about God. I do not want to consider this a doubt but merely a question out of curiosity.

Here is my question

Religious individuals say that God gave us free will because without it we would not be able to truly love him. God is all powerful and he created the universe. He created logic. Everything in this world that appears “logical” is because it was created that way. Things could be fundamentally different though it is hard to imagine that. Imagine another universe where things are just completely different. Say there no gravity, no physics not even numbers or time or anything. It’s hard to imagine, but God could have created the universe however he wanted. Logic seems to be a symptom of how things work from our perception, not a fundamental aspect of the universe. Because of this, why did God have to give us free will according to the logic of this world for us to be able to love him? Couldn’t he has just made the fundamental logic different? Not sure if this is a good or easily understood question but I’d love to hear some responses on it.

Another question/point and the main thing that gives me pause about my religion is God’s lack of revealing himself. In the Bible the Jews were God’s chosen people. Why would he choose one race of people instead of all creation? Before he revealed himself people did not know of sin and were not able to be aware that they were going against God’s commands. It would not be hard for God to simply reveal himself undeniably one time to the entire world. Why doesn’t he do this? If he did this a lot of conflicts would probably end. People would know to obey his commandments and would likely be much kinder to others. Because he does not reveal himself universally people must believe the word of men who claim to be in touch with God. There are many people who have claimed to have special connection to God who either used it for personally gain or were simply mentally unwell.

All of this brings major confusing to me. Sorry if this post is a bit scatter, but I hope my main point comes across in some way.",1752095072.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities

If it says never, it's taking the deontological stance of it’s always wrong to kill, even to save others. But this falls apart under pressure. Suppose it’s not five people, but a thousand children. And the one who would die is a terminally ill patient with seconds to live. If god still refuses to act, that doesn’t feel like perfect goodness, it feels like moral blindness. Prioritizing rule-following over staggering consequences starts to look more like failure than integrity.

If god says yes, it’s making trade-offs. One life for five. Fine. But then what about wacky trolley car scenarios that still demand an answer? Eight kittens or one lobster? 12 bankers vs one schoolteacher? Eight old people vs one toddler? Now it's just juggling outcomes like the rest of us. There would seemingly be no overarching moral principle to its answers, just some kind of utilitarian calculus. If you asked it, ""why did you sacrifice the lobster to save the eight kittens, but not the monkey to save the eleven puppies?"" what on Earth could it say?

Of course, the divine answer could be beyond our ken, but if you just kept throwing different trolley scenarios at it, it's ""yes"" and ""no"" answers by themselves are going to pile up and just start to seem arbitrary. The deontological position of never throwing the lever would get god out of this mess, but as I said in the beginning, that position becomes untenable when the stakes get high enough.

But given you a kindhearted person, your outcome is already determined as you’ll see the wallet and return it. but what if as you are about to return it, you weigh the options. You see $700 cash in the wallet which will prevent you from going homeless. Are you still programmed to return the money based on your upbringing and predetermined nature, or keep the money based on your situation. both outcomes require free will in my opinion because if you decide to keep the money, you are making the decision to not go homeless, which in itself goes against your natural pre-programmed characteristics and tendencies, yet if you decide to return the money and wallet, you’ve also made a choice to go homeless, but be true to your pre-programmed nature. in both outcomes , you are required you to exercise free will. one made to benefit you and other against you.",1752039398.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities
1luye6k,Help with making sense of a passage from Aristotle’s Metaphysics,"I’m reading book iv chapter five of the translation by John Henry MacMahon. Here Aristotle is offering a critique of the physicist view of change and its implications for the relativity of knowledge. 

One of his points is that when a thing “is casting off a quality [it] keeps something of that which is being cast off…In general, even when a thing is ceasing to exist, there is something there which is; and when it is coming into being, the something that produces it or by which it is generated must be.”

Is the suggestion here that being is not tied to existence? How can something that ceases to exist maintain qualities of what it once was? 

I think Aristotle is offering a middle argument that threads between a view of constant change and constant stability, and if that’s the case I’m not sure it’s a convincing one.

Any insight or productive redirection is welcome. ",1752004175.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities
1lur6gd,Could anyone recommend books on philosophy of mind or some ontology??,"I am a beginner in philosophy but i have some knowledge of basic concepts like cartesian dualism and the 5 aggregates from buddhism. Ive always thought about where consciousness comes from a lot and i also like to inquire about things like free will and the universe. 


Ive tried reading the basics like mind, a brief introduction and meditations, but ive found that i sort of have already thought of these concepts as a kid, i just didnt have the words to express my thoughts, and i just get a little bored reading it. On the other hand when i try reading some more difficult texts i come across so much jargon that i have to google a lot and my brain shuts down, its too difficult.


 Could someone recommend me some beginner to intermediate philosophy books that might interest me?? I think i can safely say that i roughly know the basics, and i am a deep thinker, but i struggle to read more intermediate books like mind and the world order. Could anyone recommend me any books or authors??",1751987629.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities
1lv1lr4,The idea of morals and how we can truly understand them,"What truly defines what is morally correct and what isn’t, how can we hold the idea that the way we perceive morals is correct opposed to someone like Hitler, assuming his actions were purely morally correct and justified, and yes death is often seen as negative but then I ask who’s to say that our perception isn’t a construct and that there isn’t another reality that strives for pain and death and how can we morally disagree with it?",1752011826.0,AskPhilosophy,Humanities
